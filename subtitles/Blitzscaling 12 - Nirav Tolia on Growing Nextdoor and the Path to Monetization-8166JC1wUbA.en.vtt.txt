WEBVTTKind: captionsLanguage: en- [John] Welcome to Thursday's class,we have Nirav Tolia who I've knownfor about a billionyears, I'm really tickledto be able to spend time with him.
- You were an undergrad together here.
- We were, and one of the things that --- 20 years ago- 25 years ago, yeah.
- Please, don't.
- I'm internalizing it,yeah, I'm the old one.
- That's right.
- So Nirav, one of the things peopledon't know about Nirav is he went to thehigh school that is onFriday Night Lights.
And so, what Nirav will tellyou, that's pretty closeto accurate, that's prettymuch what it was like.
- We both grew up in Texas,and so we lived the dream.
- That's exactly right, so,ok, we're gonna talk aboutnetworks and growth, and we'regonna hear Nirav talk abouthow his management haschanged as we've gone.
So why don't we just get started?- Great.
- So thanks for coming,so you want to talk aboutNextdoor, and talk abouthow it got started?- Sure, so I'm running thiscompany called Nextdoorwhich is a private socialnetwork for neighborhoods,and it's got a little bitof an unorthodox beginningbecause it's what werefer to in Silicon Valleyas a pivot, I was workingon another company,I was funded with that other company,I'd been working on it for two years,pretty high profilebackers, and about a year inwe realized that our bigvision for that company,which was called Fanbase, itwas actually a sports company,we realized that that vision was probablynot going to be realized, at least not byour implementation of the product.
And so we gnashed ourteeth for about a year,and we tried lots of different things,and when it becamevery, very, very obviousthat we weren't gonna get there,our first impulse wasactually to return the moneyto our investors, we were burned out,we were pretty defeated mentally.
- [John] Well, you knewyour investors pretty well,so you might want to givethat back to them, too.
- Yeah, I was lucky enough to be funded byBenchmark Capital, and theguy there, Bill Gurley,who I've worked with since 1999,when we started Fanbase it was 2008,and I'd worked with Bill foralmost a decade at that point.
And this was our secondgo-round, and so I hada high degree of trust anda high degree of support.
It's a real privilegeto work with guys likeBill and Benchmark, and I felt like,to some extent, we'd let them down.
And we'd gotten a highvaluation, we'd raised a lotof money, we'd had somepress around the company,and it just wasn't gonnawork, and when you'rein the middle of one ofthese things, you realizethat you're putting 110% of your life intotrying to get something to work, and whenit's not working, at first you say,well, this is just thetoil of an entrepreneur,and this is just whatit's gonna take, and I'min the salt mines, and it'snever as easy as it looks on TV.
But then there's theday of reckoning, whenyou realize that some of yourcore assumptions are wrong.
And we started to realizethat, and then we tested them,and scratched on them,and tried to iterate,and we came to a point wherewe'd really hit a brick wall.
I'll tell you a funnystory, I thought to myself,you know, I'm just maybe too old for this,I'm burned out, I need totake a little bit of time off,I'm gonna give the money back, and thengive this another swing,so I called Bill and said,let's meet, I think you knowthings aren't going well,let's talk about next steps, and we hadthis breakfast meeting in San Francisco.
He brought me a poem, and the poem is"If" by Rudyard Kipling, whichis essentially a poem aboutbecoming a man, or becoming an adult,and the implication of himgiving me this poem was,are you really ready to quit here,or are you to step up andgive this another crack?And so he basically challenged my manhood,which is an effective wayfor a venture capitalistto get an entrepreneur togo back into the salt mines.
So we got back together with the team,we contracted it from 12people to about seven,and we worked on a varietyof different ideas over thesummer of 2010, and ultimately,Nextdoor emerged from that.
That was over five yearsago, and it was pretty humblebeginning, and it was a beginning that wasmarked by failure on another idea.
We feel incredibly luckytoday that our productis used by over 50% ofAmerican neighborhoods.
We've raised over 200 million in funding,our last round a year agowas at a valuation of overa billion dollars, and so itdidn't start the orthodox way,and it didn't start smoothly,but we're on a good path now.
- Talking to Nirav whenhe was doing Fanbase,it wasn't so much about howdid you tell it wasn't working,except that you couldjust see Nirav and hisco-founder Sarah really justgrinding at it all day long,just trying to figureout how to make it work.
- We did pitch Greylock forFanbase, and they said no.
That was probably aleading indicator as well.
They came back, and ultimatelysaid yes to Nextdoor.
- We said no to somethings that have workedpretty well, too, just for the record, butsometimes you get itright, sometimes you don't.
It's remarkable to me,you've had a very, verystrong base from which to work from.
If you work backwards toStanford, even, I remember,I probably first metyou in '98 or '99, andyou guys were runningRound Zero, you and Munjal.
Could you just tell peoplewhat Round Zero was,and more than that, whatthe environment, like,that caused you to wantto start that, was like?- Yeah, and when I come back to Stanford,I realize just how lucky I was to end upon the West Coast, in the Bay Area, and ata place like Stanford,because I didn't haveambition to work in technology.
Both my parents were doctors, and I alwaysthought I would be adoctor like my parents.
I wasn't even technical,and so the fact thatI've now spent my entirecareer working for and runningconsumer internetcompanies is really part ofa really lucky, lucky paththat started at Stanford.
And so I was at Stanford,was not really so happypursuing the med schoolroute, wondering what to do,and sort of at the end of my tenure here,the internet started to pick up, and itstarted to explode pretty quickly.
And it exploded with nameslike Netscape, and Yahoo,and Amazon, and manythat you don't know nowbecause they don't exist, butsome that are still around.
I was lucky enough to bean early employee at Yahoo,which was mostly Stanfordfolks at that point,so it was like going back to a dorm,started by a couple ofStanford grad students.
And so I was one of thefirst 70 employees there,- [John] Wow, I didn't know that.
- and joined in '96 justas the company went public.
It was an incredibleride there, I didn't knowwhat I was doing, I had no training,I was not superstar, I was probably thelowest guy on the totempole, but early on,watching Yahoo and watchingthe success of the company,I started to think, maybe Ican be an entrepreneur, andmaybe someday I can startsomething like this, and SiliconValley fuels that, and evenback then it fueled that.
Of course now, it'shappening every single day.
So, as part of tryingto figure out how to bean entrepreneur, acolleague of mine and I,we were both interestedin starting companies.
We said, you know, let'snetwork and try to meetother people in Silicon Valleythat want to start companies.
We started by simply havingdinner with four or fiveof our friends, and talkingabout entrepreneurial ideasand experiences, and justbouncing things off one another.
It went so well, becauseback then if you were ajunior person at one of these companies,you were in the cube farm day and night.
You were in the officeworking like crazy, grinding,and you had no opportunity to talk aboutother things externally,back then, all of the thingsthat we have now, allof the incubators andTechCrunch type press, and everything elsethat you guys have totune into what's going on,that didn't exist, you werereally just inside your owncompany, that was the visibility you had.
- Mostly engineering, likeliquidation preferences,like nodes, none of thatstuff, there was nothing.
- There was no infrastructureon how to start aninternet company, becausethey had just been started.
There was no real history or record.
And so we wanted to go out and meet otherentrepreneurs that wereinterested in doing it.
So we had this dinner,and it went really well,and we said, okay, let'shave an other dinnera month from now, andmaybe we'll each inviteone person, and we did that,and that went really well,and before a couple of months, we realizedthat there might be aneed for an organization.
It wasn't formal, it wasn't a company,it wasn't really anything,it was just a loose communityof entrepreneurs thatwere coming together,and within a variety ofyears, because there wassuch a demand for entrepreneurstalking to each otherand learning from eachother, and networkingwith each other, within a couple of years,it became the once a month event thatmost entrepreneurs wanted to be at.
We followed a very strictmodel of invitation onlyinvites, and you know,speaking about the class,we carried forward a lotof the things that we didin those first dinners, evenwhen we hit a point of scale,where we were having dinnerswith many hundreds of people.
We did the same kindsof things to institutequality control, and soprobably at some pointduring that time, you wereinvited to one of those dinners.
The dinners, even at scale,even with hundreds of people,the format was foreveryone to separate intosmall tables of five,and so we were tryingto replicate that firstdinner, even thoughwe were at a point of scale at that point.
- Yeah, it's amazing tothink that, just as ahistorical footnote, Niravdid that with Naval Ravikant.
- Actually, he was not partof, one of the founders.
- He was one of theattendees, but there werefour co-founders of Round Zero.
- And no, that's were I met him.
- He became a co-founderof mine for a companythat we started togetherin 1999 called Epinions.
That was just where I met him.
- You want to talk about Epinions briefly?'Cos this is not yourfirst rodeo at scaling.
- Nextdoor is actually the thirdcompany I've started,you heard about Fanbase,the one that didn'twork, and there was onebefore then, calledEpinions, and I felt aftera couple of years atYahoo, and seeing thatemployee base grow from70 people to over 3000,and really experiencingthe ride of a lifetimejust being there and tryingto soak up everythingthat was going on, plusrunning Round Zero whichwas what I was essentiallydoing with a coupleof other people, runningthis thing that wasscaling, that was alittle bit like a startup.
It didn't have funding, itdidn't have revenue targets,it didn't need that kind of measurement.
It had a lot of traction,though, it definitelyhad a lot of traction, andit felt like a startup.
And it felt like somethingthat could accomplishgreat things, and change theworld, and all the thingswe want to do with startups,and so at that point,I felt, it's time, eventhough in 1999 Yahoowas absolutely thriving andflourishing, and the stockwas at one of its highestpoints, many people thoughtI was an idiot to leave at the time.
I left, and with a few peoplethat I'd met at Round Zero,started this companycalled Epinions, which wasan idea that was Naval'sidea, it actually was notmy idea, it was a greatidea, a brilliant idea.
The notion was, looking atAmazon in those early days,one of the differentiatorson Amazon was the fact thatthere were product reviewswritten by real consumers,which was completely different than theeditorially driven productreview press that wehad been used to, therewas this old publication,you guys probably don'teven know it, calledConsumer Reports, andthat's where most peoplegot their data beforethey bought products.
Then Amazon came alongand said, you know what,it's good to hear from actual consumers.
And so, Naval had thisbrilliant idea of buildinga kind of marketplaceor platform where peoplewho had expertise aboutproducts or experiencewith products could write reviews aboutthose products that theyboth loved and hated,and shoppers who werelooking for informationcould go to this platformand get the informationthey needed to makebetter buying decisions.
- [John] And it grew quite large, right?- It was a darling of thedot com boom, initially,it started relatively fast, in factwe had an article in theNew York Times magazinecalled "Instant Company"about just how fastEpinions was scaling at the beginning.
So it was blitzscaling evenbefore that was a term.
It probably scaled a littletoo fast, and at some pointwe were over 100 employees,and then the dot comboom and bust happened, andwe busted along with it.
We had to contract the company downto less than 20 people, so,it was boom, it was bust,and then little by littlethrough some very veryhard work over a number of years,it grew to be relatively successful.
- [John] Yep, I thinkmore than relatively,you guys did very well.
- It ultimately merged witha New York based companycalled DealTime, and the whole thingwas re-branded asShopping.com, which went publicin 2004, and then was bought in 2005by Ebay for over 600 million in cash.
- [John] Overnightsuccess, after 10 years.
- (laughs) You know what was interestingabout that is, there wasa lot of research thatwas done, that I saw, I thinkit was done at Stanford,that talked about themedian amount of timefrom founding to liquidityevent, and I thinkthe median time was somethingon the order of 5 1/2 years.
If we think about, foundedin 1999, I think Epinions wasApril '99 or so, and thenpublic in November 2004,that tracked that median amount of time.
Now I look at Nextdoor,which was really foundedthe summer of 2010, and here we are, overfive years, and we are not going publicanytime soon, at least not that I know of.
That's one of the thingsthat actually has changedin Silicon Valley, theway that we think aboutscaling companies, we aremore ambitious than everbecause the markets arelarger, but our pathtowards getting public and being trulyindependent has expanded, interesting.
- [John] Yeah, I think thepopular, the conventionalwisdom is that it happens fast,'cos you don't hear about this company,and it shows up in the news, and somethingthat's got billionairesminted, or whatever, I thinkthe median time to liquidityhas gone up. (unintelligible)- Yeah, and I'll say acouple things about speedand the phenomenon thatwe see, two things.
One is, there are companiesthat are almost overnightsuccesses, and as anexample I'll say Instagram.
Instagram was not anovernight success becauseKevin, the founder ofInstagram, had startedsomething before, butthat product, Instagram,was almost instantlywell regarded, and it wasalmost instantly one of thetop apps on the App Store.
Everyone is lookingfor one of those, whereyou literally have lightning in a bottle.
You just happen to havecreated something that a lot ofpeople really love, so you wantto have one of those things.
The other thing I'd mention about speed issometimes, fast up can mean fast down.
The thing you have tobe a little careful ofis, there are lots ofthings that get popularreally, really, reallyquickly, and then they losethat popularity, and they come downalmost as quickly as they went up.
A sector in general,not naming any companiesbut a sector in general that was like thatwas games, and specifically,games on Facebook.
There was a period oftime when you were gettingcows and other thingsthrown at you on Facebook,or whatever people were doing in the feed,and it was the main thing that you sawon Facebook, and now you don't see itat all, all those things are gone.
So Facebook as a distribution platform forgaming companies has dried up as quicklyas it grew into the dominant platform.
- [Student] If there's anotherbust, what do you thinkthe things that founderswho need to contracttheir companies aremost likely to mess up?- I don't know that therewill be another bust,but I do believe prettystrongly in cycles,and I think that we areat the height, or we havefor some time, been atthe height of a cycle thatfeels like it needs tocome down a little bit.
I think probably thebiggest mistake we've madethis time around is, wehave once again confusedthe coolness of an idea withthe true market potential.
People are starting thingseverywhere, and I thinkthat's great, when they goout and get venture funding,particularly at thevaluations that you're seeing,there's an implication that whatever thatfunding valuation was,the enterprise valueof the company willeventually be worth 10 or 100times whatever that thingis, and in most cases,a lot of these companiesare really good companiesthat could be run by a person who funds ithimself or herself, Ithink that's been one ofthe big changes in the internetwith Amazon Web Servicesand a lot of the toolsthat exist, you can bean entrepreneur that'sself-funded or angel fundedand then start a cashflow business, and I feellike a lot of theseventure funded things areessentially cash flowbusinesses, they're notbad businesses, but they're not greatventure funded businesses, and so when youstart to realize, youknow, my actual market is a$100 million market, but I raised money at$100 million valuation,and I need to get toa billion, you start to doa lot of unnatural things.
I think that's where we're gonna seea lot of trouble for companies.
- You usually use venturebecause you feel likeyou need to fund growthto get network effectsthat become unassailable over time, which,I think will lead tothe conversation we'reabout to have in just asecond, I think using ventureto fund a cash flow businessis almost never right.
You start to think aboutgrowth ahead of revenue,you start to think aboutupside down unit economics,it's a whole bunch of problems.
- Yeah, specifically, whatpeople are saying is usingventure money to acquirecustomers or acquire salesis the wrong way to useventure funding, unless youbelieve there's a true networkin there on the other side.
- [John] And then, Ithink what happens in acontraction is that mostpeople say, well look,I'm a small cap company,I'm worth $100 millionor $200 million or $10million, I'm not wortha billion, or a trillion, or$10 billion, or $50 billion.
It won't matter if the topof the market contracts.
I think what surprises people is howfast it kind of cascades down,you start to see tightening at the topand then it tightens down pretty quickly.
- I guess, is there abetter way to reducingway down from like 100to 20? (unintelligible)- Well, you're doing thatbecause it's the onlything you can do to stay in business.
I think, in general, whatfounders and CEOs needto think about is,there's a right way to runa company, and that waydoesn't change that muchin a boom cycle or a bustcycle, it's making surethat every head isextremely valuable, and thatyou're not growing too fastfrom a head count standpoint.
It's making sure that your assumptions areconstantly beingre-proven, it's making surethat you have a longterm strategy, and you'retaking all the smallsteps necessary to getto that strategy, a lotof the things that you doin a bust are reallygood things to do duringa boom as well, I thinkthat's what the companiesthat survived the bust lasttime, that's what they learned.
They learned that theway to operate a company,or the way that we wereforced to operate companiesin the bust, are pretty good ways tooperate the company even in a boom.
- [John] Arright, solet's move to Nextdoor.
Give us a sense ofNextdoor today, talk about,maybe, let's start withthe products, want totalk a bit about what the product is?- The premise of the productis that while we havesocial networks to easilyconnect with friendsand family, and that'sFacebook, and to peoplethat we're interestedin, and that's Twitter,and finally to ourcolleagues, that's Linkedin,there isn't a socialnetwork that will help useasily connect andcommunicate with the peopleright outside our frontdoors, and the peopleright outside our frontdoors are typicallyour neighbors, the people who live in ourneighborhoods and our local communities.
It's a little differentfor college kids, becauseyour neighborhood reallyis Stanford, and soFacebook is a perfectapplication, or whatever,Instagram, Snapchat, whatever'sbeing used on campus.
But once you leave Stanford,you move to a new place,you won't know the people around you.
When we started thecompany in 2010, we werereally shocked by thisstatistic, which is almost 30%of Americans couldn't namea single neighbor by name.
John and I will tell you,- [John] 30%.
- 30% of Americanscould not name a single,it's actually 28% of Americans could notname a single neighbor by name.
John and I know from growing up in Texas,that's not the way we grew up, we weren'tnecessarily best friendswith our neighbors,but we certainly knew them,and we relied on them,and I think, if you thinkabout your parents back homewherever home is, theyare a part of a localcommunity that they feel connected to.
When I think about my two young sons,both under three yearsof age, I don't want themto grow up in a worldwhere most of their friendsare folks that they'reconnecting to virtuallyon Facebook, or throughTwitter, that they've never met.
I want them to feel like they have rootsin the community, andso that was the premiseof the company, it wasa pretty obvious premisebut completely unproven, because peoplehad lost touch with neighborhoods.
So the notion that there'seven any value to connectingwith our neighbors, thatwas an unproven notion.
Now here we are five years later,we have over 80,000 neighborhoods that areusing Nextdoor, that's roughly 50%.
We think there are 165,000neighborhoods in America, themedian size of those neighborhoodsis about 700 households.
- [John] I think one ofthe stats, because I thinkit will be good to give people a sense ofthe scale we're talking about.
- And while he's bringingthis up, almost 50%of American neighborhoods, but over 90%of the neighborhoods in the top 40 cities,so, in almost every majorcity, if you want toconnect with yourneighbors using technology,you're gonna use Nextdoor,and what's interestingabout Nextdoor, particularlyin the context ofthis class, is that it wasnot an overnight success,and it's still not an overnight success.
It was a very long, hard, road, continuesto be, but it's picking up steam.
We've got a couple of slideshere that we're bringing up,and I'll talk you throughthese, but the basicnotion is that when westarted the company,because this thing Fanbasethat we'd been working on,because it hadn't worked, and with Fanbasewe had this grandambition of, can we createbottoms up community,to create a competitorfor ESPN, that was the grand visionfor Fanbase, we didn't get anywhere.
When we started Nextdoor, it was much lessabout the grand vision,now Halloween is a veryneighborly holiday, sowe've got the Halloweenfaces here, I'm not sure ifthere's any trick or treatinggoing on here at Stanford, but, you know,once you get out you'll realizethere is trick or treating.
But when we startedNextdoor, we were probablya lot less ambitious withour long term vision,because we'd just come off a failure.
What we were very focused on was, can wejust make this thing work in a small setof neighborhoods, so we can get a proofof concept, what people commonlyrefer to as product/market fit.
So now we can go to the next slide.
I'm gonna go back asfar as 2013, of coursewe started the company even before then,and you can see, if welook at a couple of ourkey metrics, let's thinkof them as almost growth,and engagement, and thenfinally, external validation,you see a couple of things,you see tremendous growth,but look at the scale of growth recently.
And so, this is blitzscaling,from a metric standpoint.
This is John's favorite essay,"Do Things that Don't Scale"at the beginning, and ifyou get those things right,- [John] Can you talkabout how you do that?- Yeah, if you go to the next slide,I think I have it in the next slide.
Our first year of Nextdoor,we had 176 neighborhoods.
It took us an entire yearto get 176 neighborhoodsto use the service, andmy co-founders and I,we talked to most ofthe people that startedevery one of these neighborhoods.
To start a neighborhood on Nextdoor,you have to put in youraddress, you have todraw the boundaries of the neighborhood,you have to name the neighborhood,and then, in some periodof time, 14 to 21 days,you have to get nine of your neighborsto join, and all verify their addresses.
So, starting a neighborhood is not easy.
If you think about, 30%of Americans don't knowa single neighbor, wewere looking for thoseneighbors that knew at least nine others.
That's how we couldcreate that critical mass.
- [John] This is alittle counterintuitive,because if you didn't get that done, you'dsend a note and say,good try, we're going toturn off your neighborhood for a while.
- If you started aneighborhood and you didn'thave 10 people, it was called a pilot,and the pilot would expire,originally in 14 daysand then eventually weextended it to 21 days,and of the 80,000 neighborhoodswe have, we probablyhave another 80 to 90,000pilots that have expired.
It was a quality control mechanism, almosta game mechanic, becausewe said to ourselves, look,when we're building these neighborhoods,we need to build the right foundation.
If someone comes along,like John, and says,Oh, I'm gonna use thisfor my own personal gain,I'm gonna call this Johnand the Boys in the Hood,I'm gonna draw a boundarythat's not very sensiblebut that makes a lot of sense for me, andI'm just gonna invitemy friends that agreewith everything that Isay, well, that wouldn'tmake for a very useful neighborhood.
The people who typically know nine or moreof their neighbors arethe folks who care deeplyabout their localcommunities, they're the oneswho care about NeighborhoodWatch, they're the oneswho care about neighborsgetting to know each other,they're the ones whowelcome the new neighborsthat move into theneighborhood, they're the onesthat act as the socialglue, and those are the onesthat we were seeking, butit was very counterintuitivebecause, if you thinkabout it, it takes usan entire year to get 176 neighborhoods,and we know that there are165,000 in the country,well, you can do themath, how many years wouldit take us, at that runrate, to get penetration?It would take us a lifetime, right.
But we were focused on something differentthan establishing the run rate for growth.
We were focused on quality, and that wasvery, very important for us,if we go to the next slide,- [John] Wait, so onething, you keep usingthis word neighborhood,which I think we allthink we understand in our heads, but,neighborhood's not at all an obvious thingwhen you try to draw the lines, right?So you almost needed to figureout what they meant, right?- Yeah, there's sort ofan interesting fork thatwe were confronted withearly on in the genesisof this idea, and thatfork was, do we try tomodel ourselves around Twitter?The notion of Twitteris, you can tune intoconversations based on who you like, andwho you want to follow, and it's not evensymmetric in terms of youneeding to get approvalto follow someone's tweets, and we said,if Nextdoor were likethat, you would just put inan address, and thenyou could tune into allthe conversations goingon in some geographicradius or proximity to that address.
And you could changethat, like if I'm comingdown here, I could say, showme all the conversationsthat neighbors are havingin Palo Alto, as an example.
The Facebook way,particularly the way thatMark started Facebook if you remember,you had to have a university email addressto join the Facebook for that university.
I had to use my Stanfordalumni address to joinstanford.facebook.com, andthat was very different,because it made me feel likeI was part of a community.
It was harder to getcritical mass, becauseit was just people whohad gone to Stanford,or were at Stanford, thatwere part of that community,but it made me feel some identity.
And so we decided earlyon, every one of theseneighborhoods is gonnahave a discrete boundary.
That meant we needed tobuild a geospatial platformin addition to a socialnetworking platform.
We decided that every oneof these neighborhoodsis gonna have a distinctname, and every oneof these neighborhoods needsto have identity behind it,because when you asksomeone where they grew up,tell me again the city whereyou grew up, San Antonio?- [John] San Antonio.
- So he grew up in San Antonio, butif he met someone in San Antonio,he would say, this is the neighborhoodI grew up in, whatever it was.
- Well, in fact I did, Isat with Josh earlier, andwe talked about how my wifegrew up in Alamo Heights,and which part of San Antonio,yeah, that's exactly right.
- And so, it's a veryimportant part, in fact,the interesting sociologicalexperiment we did,is we said, when you meetsomeone for the first time,say, at a party, what arethe things you talk about?Well, I go up to John,and I say, Hey John,nice to meet you, why are you here?And he says, Oh, this is Peter's party,and Peter's a friendof mine, and I say, Oh,Peter's a friend of mine,too, that's sort of Facebook.
Now I notice that he'swearing a Stanford shirt.
And I say, Oh, you like Stanford?And he says, Yeah, I went to Stanford.
And I say, Oh, I wentto Stanford, too, andthat's a little bit of Facebook,a little bit of Twitter.
Then, the next thing, ifyou're in Silicon Valley,is you say, Where do youwork, what do you do?That's always a part of your identity.
And he says, Oh, I'm a venture capitalist.
I say, Oh, interesting,that's sort of Linkedin.
But almost every singletime when you meet someone,and think back to when you met people yourfreshman year and whenyou meet people now,you say, Where are you from, right?And the person says, Oh, I'm from Texas.
Where in Texas, this littlecity in west Texas, Odessa,where in Odessa, andit just keeps tunnelingall the way down until youtypically hit the neighborhood.
And that's a big part ofknowing who someone is.
We felt that notion of identitywas extremely important.
It was the hardest decision we made fora couple of differentreasons, one is, there is noobjective encyclopedia ofneighborhood boundaries.
People argue about neighborhoodboundaries all the time.
We needed to create aWikipedia type systemwhere we would have the community createa set of boundaries, that was hard.
The second thing we saidis we're gonna make theconversations private, unlessyou live in the neighborhood.
Everyone who joins Nextdoorhas to verify where they live.
Very counterintuitive, people talk aboutreducing friction, we increase friction.
Finally, we said, there isn'teven gonna be a neighborhoodunless 10 neighbors can cometogether in 21 days, question?- How did you find thesepeople who are so integratedinto their community,like the 170 individualsacross the country thatyou were working with?- We started in the Bay Area,and we started by asking allof our friends, it was basicallylike a game of Telephone.
We would ask all of ourfriends, do you know anyonewho's really involved in the community?And they would say, well,I know these people,and we'd talk to them,and if they were people,then we'd say, Can youstart it in your community,if they weren't, we'dsay, Do you know someone,and it would just feather out that way.
At this point, and this isreally one of the lessons,I think, around scaling,all of those things thatwe did manually, weinitially manually verifiedpeople's addresses, we would say,Can you send me a pictureof your driver's license?Or, can we get a Homeowner's Associationroster, and go through there one by one,and get people to be verified?We would go door to doorto get people to join.
There are all thesethings we did completelymanually, where we rolled up our sleeves,and it was very dirtywork, and it was nevergoing to be scalable, and we knew it.
We were just lookingfor signal in the noise.
Then systematically,since then, we have madethose unscalable thingsscalable with technology.
That's what has enabled that growth.
Systematically, we've takenverification, made it automated.
We've taken neighborhood boundaries,the whole thing's automated.
Now, if you want to joinNextdoor, you come in,you put in your address, you're put intoan automated applicationthat then dumps youinto the pilot program whichis completely automated,all the reminders in the earlydays, my co-founder Sarahwould call these neighborhoodsthat were getting started,that only had five people,and she'd call up the personand say, C'mon, you cando it, you can do it!Just invite one more person,they might know another person.
Now, we have all those hooksbuilt into the platform.
So, we just looked forsignal, we looked for fit,we looked for somefidelity, and some notionthat what we built wasreal we didn't worry abouthow are we gonna scale this, we had toworry about that next,and we've been worryingabout it ever since, butinitally, we focused on quality.
And as we think aboutthe organization today,back then it was sevenpeople, now it's over 100,we try to do the same thing today.
We actually separate the company, we haveorganizations likeengineering, product, design,et cetera, but we sitpeople, typically, inproject groups where we have a designer,a product person, five orsix engineers, an analyst,and we tell them, Let's try to simulatewhat Nextdoor was like in the early days.
It's okay if you do scalable things.
To take an example, recentlywe launched a featureon Nextdoor, which is findinga babysitter on demand.
One of the things that youdo in your neighborhoodall the time, is you ask for a babysitter.
So wouldn't it be cool ifyou could find a babysitteras easily as you can find a car on Uber?- [John] You guys all havethis problem all the time.
- Well, you guys could be the supply sideif you wanted, not the demand side.
When we piloted this,which we've been pilotingin Palo Alto and a coupleof other neighborhoods,we had the team members go and literallywalk around Palo Alto to try to findbabysitters to sign up for the service.
Clearly, that's not theway we're gonna do itlong term, but we got supply to a pointwhere we could testdemand, demand and supplywere matched, and nowwe're looking at wayshow can we actually productize this.
- [John] I'm struck byall the similarities,there's so many similarities betweenNextdoor and Linkedin,and a lot of differentpoints in the thing, probably it's becauseby the end, you're gonna have this assetthat looks like Linkedin,which is very, very hardto assail (drowned out by Nirav).
- Well, let me show you some of the data,because, I think, the data isvery interesting to look at.
This is where we are now, all50 states, we've got Alaskaand Hawaii in there, goto the next slide please,we've made it a goal toget highly penetratedin the major cities,because as we think aboutbuilding a competitive moatagainst any competitor,we want to own the mostvaluable cities in America,and these are some of them, and these arethe percentages ofneighborhoods in these cities.
You'll also see somethinginteresting, which isNextdoor is a true mass market phenomenon,it's not a Silicon Valley phenomenon.
You're gonna see cities allover the map here, literally.
You got Manhattan, Los Angeles, Houston,Washington D.C., go to the next one.
Now, to get a little bit more interesting,this is engagement, how frequentlydo people use the product,and the solid lineis, how frequently do our members, and thedenominator's all registeredmembers, so this iseveryone who's eversigned up for Nextdoor,41% is actually the jaggedline, that's the percentageof our members who use theservice every other day.
It's remarkably consistent,the two dips areThanksgiving and Christmas, and what'sinteresting about it is,the reason it's consistentis because, while we'vehad to work to scalethe number of neighborhoods,we have not hadto work to scale thequality of the experience,because the quality of the experiencewas figured out in those early days.
Now, we just need moreneighborhoods using this thing.
- [John] Allen said thattoo, Allen Blue said,we're patient, we're content to go slow,until we figure out whatmade people really love it,and then you figure outways to put it out there.
- There's a time toactually step on the gas,and that time is when you'resure of where you're going,and you can be sure of where you're goingyou're going when your users tell you thatthey love the product, go to the next one.
- [John] Every other dayusage is a pretty good signal.
- The ultimate goal forconsumer internet productis what Google calls the toothbrush test.
We use our toothbrush once a day,hopefully some of us twice a day, and socan you create a productthat people are usingevery single day, that'sthe dream, question?- [Student] Going back alittle bit, you talked abouthow you piloted these170 neighborhoods to seeif there was any signal,but how did you knowthese neighborhoods were representative ofthe rest of the U.S.
(drowned out by Nirav)?- That's a really, really good question.
We worked hard to tryto get a cross sectionof geographic diversity,socioeconomic diversity,we wanted rural and urban and suburban,we wanted senior folksand young folks, andwhat was pretty interestingis, the use casesdid have some variation fromneighborhood to neighborhood.
In some neighborhoods, peoplewere looking for babysitters.
In the Marina in SanFrancisco, which is wheremany people go after theygraduate from Stanford,no one's looking for ababysitter, but they dowant to know what'sgoing on on Friday night.
So it's a different kind ofconversation that you havewith your neighbors, andsenior citizen communitiesin Florida, there areneighbors that want toactually do bridge nightsand solitaire nights,and that sort of thing, sothe conversation differed,but the quality of engagementand the basic human needto connect with people around me, thatwas incredibly consistent,but it's a good question,because we did, becausewe were coming off ofa failed startup, have a lotof skepticism about ourselves.
So we did the first one, we said, well,this is just in MenloPark, anything would workin Menlo Park, so then we did another one,(John laughs)and we said, well, that'sjust Portola Valley,okay now, all we've got is a littlecoincidence, Menlo Parkand Portola Valley.
So we said, let's force ourselves to gooutside of California,so we went to Seattle.
And then it worked inSeattle, and we said,Well, maybe that's stilljust a tech kind of thing.
Ultimately, we made our way in that first175 neighborhoods to Hamilton, New York,which is about as different a neighborhoodas we've probably everlived in, because we wouldsee postings in thatneighborhood of things like,I've lost my cow, my cow is wanderingaround the neighborhood, can a neighborplease tell me if they've seen my cow.
That's not what you seein either Menlo Park,or Portola Valley, or anySan Francisco neighborhood.
But the conversation was still rich there,and it was stillsomething that we felt hadvery strong signal, sowe again, systematically,sometimes failure canbe a very very powerfulmotivational tool, almost always, I think.
We had this spectre of, yeah, but is itreally working, is it really working?My wife asked me, when wecrossed 80,000 neighborhoods,which was just this week, she said,"Can you believe it,80,000 neighborhoods!"I remember when you told the company,that first summer, if we get to 100neighborhoods, we'llbring a dim sum cart intothe company and give everyone dim sum,and we'll call it the Dum Sum 100.
And our engineers lookedat me like I was crazy.
We'll never get 100 neighborhoodsin 90 days, that's crazy!We got to 100, and Iremember telling them,if we get to 10,000, we'regonna do the Tuscany 10,000.
Well, we never went toTuscany, because we're scalinga lot more quickly now,but even when my wife said,(laughter)we've run out of money,even though we've raised$200 million, we can't takeall the employees to Tuscany.
I did tell, I think wesaid, we do have some goalabout founders shavingtheir heads if we hitsome extreme number ofmillion, double digitmillions users, or something like that.
The idea was, and stillis, we haven't made it.
We're working hard every single day,and we're motivated by the fact that everysingle day, we get somepositive data points,and we're just gonna keep going.
There's this old quote,I'm not sure, it maybe like a Sun Tzu quote,but the journey ofa thousand miles begins with a single stepor something, I'm not surewho it's attributed to,- [Student] Mao.
- Okay, so it's a Mao quote,sorry, I was a little off.
(laughter)Don't quite know my Asian historians.
- [John] Very super similar, oh yeah.
- But that is very truefor us, it's not truefor all businesses, by the way.
It's not true for all businesses,but for us, it's absolutely true.
The only way for us to getthere, and get there for us is,we want to be used by every neighbor,in every neighborhood,every day, around the world.
- [John] This story you toldabout, maybe this is justPalo Alto, or maybe it's justPortola Valley, whatever,it reminds me of my very, veryfavorite thing that anybodyin Silicon Valley has eversaid, it's Andy Grove saying"Fight like you're right, andlisten like you're wrong."What he meant is thathe wanted everybody tocome out of the strongproduct point of viewabout what's right, andhe wanted them to berelentless about lookingfor data to figureout whether it was wrong or not.
- The interesting thingabout data is, yourinstinct and your intuition can be wrong.
Data, if it's interpreted correctly, isvery, very rarely wrong,and so what you seeup here is what I commonly refer to as oneof my favorite slides,what this shows here isa very systematic,consistent, predictable growthacross neighborhoods, growthin size of members joining.
What we've done here is we've cohortedthe total number of neighborhoods we have,which is changing over time because we'readding more neighborhoods,we've cohorted themand we've said, Whatpercentage of the entire cohortcorresponds to what size ofmembers in a neighborhood?You go back about 2 1/2years ago, Q1 of 2014,almost 60% of our neighborhoods hadless than 100 neighbors using NextdoorWe were just gettingstarted, it's literallylike growing a tree, thefirst couple years yougrow a tree you don't see anything.
But if you go to Muir Woods and you seesome of those incredibletrees, those are treesthat have been around for a long time.
So what you see here,with the green slowlybut surely, systematicallygrowing, is thatall of our neighborhoodsget larger over time.
The denominator here, 2013, is 7000.
Over in 2015, it's 80,000.
So all these neighborhoodsare getting bigger.
Let's to to the next slide, I think?- [John] Yeah, Dropbox had a,I love this idea, because you're gettingevery cohort getting stronger over time.
Dropbox had a chartlike this which is everycohort is making more moneythan the month before.
- Do you have increasing marginal utility?- [John] That's right,when you start stackingthese things, you geta very, very fast ramp.
- You know you have anetwork business, I mean,what's the definition of a network effect?Every node that's added addsvalue to the entire network.
That's a little bit what you're seeing.
I'll just show you this, andthen I'll take some questions.
This is pretty interesting,this is looking athousehold penetration by neighborhood,and the neighborhoods thathave launched on Nextdoorcohorted by their launch year date.
The green line here isall of our neighborhoodsthat were launched in 2012, sothese are neighborhoods that arethree years old, and theyare now 30% penetrated.
So, 30% of the peoplein those neighborhoods,and it's the entirebasket of neighborhoods,is using Nextdoor, what'sinteresting is thatthe next year, 2013, which is theorange line, it's closely tracking.
We're doing a little better, but it'svery closely tracking 2012.
Same for 2014, it's veryclosely tracking 2013 and 2012,and then you look at2015, it's about the same.
So what I told John is,if you see this kind ofpredictability, and you cantake a step back as a CEOand say, okay, as long asthis continues, I know thattoday, we have 50% of theneighborhoods in the country.
I also know that at some pointin time, that's years away,not many years away, allof those neighborhoodswill have at least 30%penetration, and more,actually, because it doesn'tplateau, it keeps going.
What that essentially saysfor me is, and the board,this is what VC's do, they saw this chartand they said, Sir, are you telling mewe could fire everyone in the company?(John laughs)And at some point, inthe next three years,50% of the neighborhoods in America wouldhave 30% of their population on Nextdoor?That's not actually true,you couldn't fire everyone,you'd have to keep some of the engineersto keep the site up,but it's largely true.
Which is awesome, not the firing part,but it's awesome from apredictability part becausea lot of businesses thatwe see are what I wouldrefer to as treadmill businesses.
Every morning you wake up, andyou gotta go take a run on the treadmill.
Those miles that you'reaccruing, that distance thatyou're travelling, you don'tget any credit for it tomorrow.
It's just one day, you doeverything you can, and thenthe next day, you've gottaearn the whole thing again.
The really good networksbusinesses that accruevalue over time, it'snot a treadmill business.
Every single step you take is addingincremental value to the whole.
That is Linkedin, that isthe definitional qualityof Linkedin, and it's something thatwe hope is gonna be true of Nextdoor.
- [John] I see a question from over here.
- [Student] So how are you gonna keeppeople on the platform once they've madethe connection there,and (too quiet to hear)- We should repeat thequestion, (unintelligible).
- So, sorry, how do wekeep people on the platformonce they're there, andthen the second part?- [Student] Right, so becausethere's a lot of caseswhere, you know, people go on theplatform and make the connection,(not clear)- You know, we've been pretty lucky.
When you have a platform that the averageof all users is that 40% of those usersare using the platform every other day,there's something that's sopowerful in the core engagementof being able to tune into what's going on in yourneighborhood, and therereally is no substitute.
That's not actually a problemthat we think about that much.
We don't have a lot ofchurn, we don't havea lot of people who usethe platform a lot and thengo off and decay overtime, which sometimeshappens in gaming, you use the thing a lotand then you're like,I'm sick of it, I'm donewith Farmville, I can't do it again.
What we see, on the otherhand, is the opposite.
People, they go in a littlecarefully, and then over time,as more neighbors joinand as the informationis richer and as theirutility actually deliversmore value, they use the product more.
I didn't show you a cohortwhere we take our neighborhoodsand we say, Whichneighborhoods have the highestengagement, and what you would see is theneighborhoods that arethe largest have thehighest engagement, which is also great.
'Cos all the neighborhoodsare getting larger.
The one other thing I'dsay is, we're very luckyin that there isn't an obvious substitute.
John and I were talking aboutit, there is no internetcompetitor, really, nor isthere an offline competitor.
It used to be, when I was at Stanford, Iactually subscribed to the Chronicle,as a student at Stanford,a lot of people did.
- [John] Is that a newspaper?- That is a newspaper. (laughter)Dead trees, the whole thing.
- [John] Words on paper.
- And so, I would get informtionabout the local community.
I'd read the Daily, I'd readthe Chronicle, and that was it.
I wouldn't go to CNN.com orwhatever, I'd maybe watchthe news, but that's whereI'd get the information.
Today, I don't know anyonethat reads a newspaper.
So, how do you tune in to what's going onaround you, we have to crowdsource that.
- [Student] You said youhad 40% retention rate now?Do you remember how it was forthe first neighborhood in Menlo Park?- Incredibly consistent,and you can actually,if you go back one slide,you'll be able to see it,because, one more slide,what's interesting hereis, this goes all theway back to June of 2014,and it's the same basic average.
What that means is, back thenwe had incredible retention,and today we do, now I always tell people,two sides to the coin, thegood news is, 40% are using itevery other day, the badnews is it's not 60%.
It turns out that whenyou slice the cohortsa little more finely, youfind that the more establishedneighborhoods, which areolder and larger, they dohave increased engagementrates, so it does get better.
- [John] As a product thinker,when you look at that chart,it's nice that you have it,'cos it provides you a base,does it seem hard to increase it?As a product thinker, yousaid, maybe there's nothingwe can do in the product,it's just natural.
- I would say, and thecompany would agree with me,our product is verycoarse, it's not a wellrefined product, andthe reason for that is,we're actually not a product company.
We're a communitycompany, and so the thingthat we've focused on, andthe thing that we've built andthe thing that we obsessed aboutall the time, is community,and community is why wehave 80,000 neighborhoods.
The product that servicesthose communities,there's a lot of upside, a ton of upside.
All we have to do islook at the neighborhoodsthat have the most penetration to seerates that are much higher than 41%.
It's really aboutgetting all neighborhoodsto be like the best neighborhoods.
- [Student] What are yourbiggest growth bottlenecks,and how did you figure out what they were?- We have a core growthbottleneck that is,it's sort of an interestingconceit, becausethe bottleneck is also thereason for the service.
Social networks typicallygrow through virality,and virality is, I inviteyou to the service becauseI'm gonna get somethingout of inviting you.
Google is not a viralservice, you tell people aboutGoogle because you just likeit, it's word of mouth driven.
But Linkedin, you senda connection requestto someone because you want to beconnected to them, so we're the latter.
Interestingly, though, because Americansdon't know their neighbors, they have nomechanisms to invite their neighbors.
The reason it's an interesting conceit is,if they did know theirneighbors, there would beno reason for Nextdoor to exist.
The reason that growthis so difficult for us isbecause of the valueproposition we're tryingto create, which is, peopledon't know their neighbors,so they can't easily invite them.
If you think about Snapchat,and Snapchat's growth,and we think aboutInstagram's growth as well,the social graph is something thatFacebook doesn't have a monopoly on.
All of us who have phonesare carrying aroundour own social graph on our phone.
It's not actually unique to Facebook.
So, when a new servicestarts, if it's a servicethat relies on yourfriends, you can typicallyhit one button, and bang,that whole thing is populated.
There is no easy way forus to go neighborhoodby neighborhood andpopulate the whole thing.
We have to find one neighborwho knows two neighbors,and those two neighborsknow two neighbors,so we sort of systematicallygrow that way.
We accelerated or heightenedour growth problemby making a decision earlyon that our conversationswould be private, so that means no SEO,no social sharing, so both the viralityand the discoverability of Nextdoor,both of those thingsare severely hampered.
Which, is why, if he lookedat this company before,and we were just sortof white boarding it,he'd say, you've pickeda very, very difficultexecution path, because mostof these things will groweither because they'reintrinsically viral,or because they're easily discoverable.
We've actually done theopposite in both cases.
Now, how do we fight those things?We've done some pretty unique things.
On the invitation side,we have many members,our primary way of growing is neighborsinvite their neighborsto the service, but ifthey don't know theirneighbors, they don't knowtheir email addresses, how do they do it?We pay for them to look ata map of their neighbors,and click on the housesthey want to invite,and then we will actually senda postcard on their behalf.
- [John] You'll still do that?- We will send, this year,many millions of dollarsof postcards, I think on theorder of 20 to 25,000 a day.
The nice thing is, everyone of these postcards,one of our members has said, I wantto invite that neighbor to the service.
In the early days, you'dsee all these tweetswhere someone would say, Wow,this is really old school,and they'd be showing a pictureof a postcard from Nextdoor.
It's like, do you really usea postcard to get someoneto join an online service,right, a little counterintuitive.
- I wanted to talk aboutnearby neighborhoods,that was a (Nirov's voice drowns him out)- One of the things youalso want to look at isthat virality, is there a way to increasethe viral vector thatyou could possibly have?Because, if I say to you,I live in San Francisco,you live in Palo Alto, there'sno reason for me to inviteyou to Nextdoor becausewe're never gonna interact.
But maybe if we can connectPalo Alto to Menlo Parkin some way, 'cos thereare some conversations,the neighbors in PaloAlto and the neighborsin Menlo Park may wantto have, classifieds,for example, where youhave an extended market.
We came up with a featurecalled Nearby Neighborhoods,where today, we not only connect you withyour immediate neighbors, we allow youto also communicate with about the10,000 closest householdsin other neighborhoods.
Those can be contiguous neighborhoods,that are on your border, or they can beneighborhoods that are not exactly onyour border, but very close to you.
That did two things, it created a betterviral vector for growth,but the other thing it did,is, it increased theutility of the service,because, for example,if you have a lost dog,and you want to tell yourneighbors you have a lost dog,your dog doesn't knowthat he's now leavingyour neighborhood, and so no one elseis going to be able to find him, becausehe's going to the next neighborhood over.
We had many people who said, the utilityof the service will bebetter if I can communicatewith a broader set ofpeople, and there wereother people who said, Ilive right on a boundary,I feel like I'm reallypart of both of theseneighborhoods, and how can you proxy that?So it wasn't just agrowth driver, it was aquality of experience driver, and I thinkold school internet is the bestgrowth driver, is a great product.
You hear a lot about growth hacking andthat sort of thing, but ultimately,for a service like ours,every time we do somethingthat really delightsour members, we see a puff of growth.
- [John] It seems to me, italso increased engagementa little bit, so it increased the densityof the people who were around you?- It got to the pointwhere, so, as an example,the number one use case on Nextdoor is,I'm looking for a serviceprovider, so it could bea babysitter, or apainter, or a contractor,a doctor, dentist, etcetera, and that's 26%of our 11 or 12 million messages a day.
Those typically haveabout 15 to 20 minutesbefore you get your firstresponse from a neighbor.
Over a 24 hour period, you typicallywill get a median of 5 1/2 replies.
That's pretty incredible,if you think about it,there's a platform outthere where you can askyour neighbors for aservice provider, and withinhalf an hour, you'llget one answer, and inthe next 23 1/2 hours,you're gonna get four more.
That's pretty powerful,but we needed to increasethe density of people thatcould respond to that query,and that's somethingNearby Neighborhoods did.
- [John] I'm just gonnaput this thing on autoplayfor the rest of the time,there's plenty of questions.
- [student] How did you thinkabout revenue (unintelligible)- Good question! Money!- How am I thinking about revenue?- Yeah, how'd you solvethe money equation?- I'm not sure if Reidhas copped to this, butin the early days, whenwe were starting a companyand I was leaning onReid heavily for advice,because he's built something like this, orsomething that we aspireto be, to follow in thefootsteps of, he said, oneway I think about it is,you build user scale,you build usage scale,and then you build revenue scale.
It's this notion that,when building a platformwith indirect monetization,which is to say,we will not charge our members directly,we need to monetize throughads, or some servicesthat we provide them,or something like that,the path that you dothose things in, becauseeach one of these problems, growth,engagement, and monetization, each oneof these problems are very difficult.
The only way to solve them is tobreak them into sequential steps.
The first thing you do is you figure outa reason for people to simply join.
Once you've figured thatout, you can move onto a reason for peopleto stay on the serviceonce they've joined,and use it, once you'vefigured that out, then youcan move to monetization.
That's actually the paththat Twitter and Facebookhave followed, I thinkboth of those companieswere probably four tosix years in before theystarted to truly monetize,and that's where we are today.
2016 is a really big yearfor us, I have an offsitetomorrow morning, where,as a management team,we're gonna talk about2016 and how it's reallygonna be a great yearfor monetization for us.
We feel like the platform froma user and usage standpointis at scale, so now it'stime to capture value, yes.
- [Student] What product insights can youderive from the continuedusage of Craigslist,given that it's still the same?(John laughs)- That's a great, greatquestion, I think marketplacesare typically driven byliquidity over productexperience, that's the number one.
- That's the question, was,more or less, what can youfigure out becauseCraigslist is so strong.
- Or, said a differentway, why is Craigsliststill around when a thousand companieshave tried to take it down, and from asuperficial standpoint,it hasn't, there's nomobile app that's great for Craigslist,it's not intrinsicallybuilt for a mobile world,all these things that yousee in great products.
I think, ultimately, yougo to buy things wherethe sellers are, and you go to sell thingswhere the buyers are, andCraigslist still has a lockin a couple of categorieslike real estate,and personals, and others where it's stillthe best marketplace out there.
We have a slightly differenttake on it, becauseCraigslist is a marketplace where you cango there anonymously, and youcan buy and sell anonymously.
That's not the way Nextdoor works.
Nextdoor, you have to verify your address,you have to put your real name in.
Classifieds, for us andCraigslist, that's notthe direct competitor, we don't believethat there's a lot ofbusiness value for us there.
We think they're doing a pretty good job,and we don't have a wayof getting that kindof scale because of our model.
I think, for other startupsthat are going after Craigslist,it's not about creating a prettier UI,it's about getting thoseaudiences to shift,and that is very, very hard to do.
- Marketplaces are all about whetherthe transaction clears or not, if you putsomething up for sale,you want to make sureit sells, and nobody has liquiditylike Craigslist, it's brutal to beat them.
- Sure.
- [Student] (too quiet)- Yeah, that's a great question,so, I use this frameworkbecause it has been veryhelpful in the companiesthat I've been part of,which is, at any given time,you have five objectives in a company.
You have growth, you have engagement,you have monetization,you have infrastructure,and you have people, so those arefive distinct things that you can beworrying about at any given time.
If you think about your total resources,or your total focus, as a piechart of all of those things,you have to figure out,what are the size ofthe slices at any given point in time.
Sometimes, that point intime is annual, sometimesit can be quarterly,sometimes it's even briefer.
If you have an outage, for example.
Interestingly, a lotof these services thatget scale quickly, they go from spendingno resources on infrastructure,and we did that,to spending a lot ofresources on infrastructure.
For us, if I go a little forward, 2014,towards the end of 2013, 2013 wasall about growth for us, and we haven'tput any percentage of theresources on monetizationfor a long time, nowwe're about to get there.
We've actually putsurprisingly few resourceson engagement, because inthe first instantiation,2011, we spent a lot of time,176 neighborhoods, we werenot focused on growth, wewere focused on engagement.
The next year, 2012,was more about growth.
2013 was, again, aboutgrowth, and then 2014,we needed to actually invest inthe service, because it was coming down.
We couldn't handle thenumber of concurrentmessages that were beingsent, and that sort of thing.
Again, as we move forward to 2016,I am thinking alongwith the management teamabout, across these fivethings, what's gonnaget dialed up, what'sgonna get dialed down.
The pie itself getsbigger, because you raisemore money, you hire more people,you have more resources, assumingthat things are goingwell, but ultimately,those are the five knobs thatI believe we can control.
As we look toward 2016, 'cos my memory,I probably don't remember2012 at this point,it's been overwritten, I havelimited hard drive space,2016 certainly we'regonna dial up monetizationquite a bit, growthfor us in 2016 is aboutinternational expansion, so we're notnecessarily dialing growth down, but we'redirecting it towards a different target,whereas we've been domestic to date.
And then, I think thatthere should be, I mean,interestingly, of the 50 or60 engineers that we have,30% at all times arededicated to infrastructure,what we call core engineering.
That's a lot of resources, that's a bigslice of the pie that'son core engineering.
Then people is somethingthat, you guys talkabout this in your class,as you start to scalethe organization, youneed to spend more ofyour resources thinking about how to takecare of your people, howto create career pathsfor them, how to thinkabout organizationalstructures that maximize the talentthat you have in the organization.
So we're dialing uporganization and people,we're dialing up monetization,we have more resources,so in some cases, even though I say we'redialing down growth,we still have the samenumber of resources towardsgrowth, it's just asa percentage of the whole,it's gone down a little bit.
- [John] Can you talk abouthow the planning process,you talk about setting these priorities,you've got an offsite, how has thatchanged as you've gotten bigger?You're up over 100 people now,heading toward Dunbar's number.
- I think what happensas you get larger, isyou have a clearer grasp on the near term,which gives you the freedom tospend a little bit more timeplanning the near and themid to long term, I'd say.
In the early days ofthe company, think about2010-2011, we were notdoing annual planning.
It just didn't make any sense.
We were literally havingstandups every weekthinking about, what are wetrying to accomplish this week.
So now we're at a point,and I've just hired agreat executive for HR to come in,because, again, we wantto dial up our investmenton people, and one of thethings she told me was,we're doing this 2016 planning, and that'sall fine, but what's the bigger picture?Where are we at the end of 2017?Where are we at the end of 2018?And for so long, I thought, I can barelykeep track of what'sgoing on next quarter.
I can't think about next year.
But then I started torealize the reason it's soimportant at our stage to think about 2017and even beyond is, if wedon't set that big goaland then work backwards, we may not choosethe right things to do in 2016.
What happens over time is, you have morepeople involved, that's sort of obvious.
We try to create real bottoms up planningof the real initiatives,and so again, as a companygets larger, you wantto get as many peopleinvolved as possible, but it's hard to do.
You have to develop processes to do that,so it's not just chaotic,so we, typically, as amanagement team say, inthese five areas, here'san OKR, an objectiveand a key result in eachof these areas, but how,that's sort of the what,and maybe, at a higherlevel for me as CEO,I have to articulate why,why is this important.
So I start with why, the team comes in andhelps us understand what, but then the howis something that we wanteveryone in the companyto participate in,because they're the onesthat are actually creating this value.
When you're small,you're doing that all inone room, in a verysort of haphazard, like,you don't want that overhead,offsites and thinkingabout strategic planning,and, you know, this issort of paralysis byanalysis in the early days.
But as you get a little further on, youneed to dial that up a little bit.
- [Student] Could youtalk about one or twoof the strategies or tacticsyou're (unintelligible)?- Yeah, so I was very lucky,with Epinions, to havea guy named Bill Campbell on my board,who's my CEO coach, and he's probably themost incredible mentor, advisor, coach,management kind ofexpert in Silicon Valley.
In fact, I used to joke,when he was coaching me,he was also coaching SteveJobs, and Eric Schmidtat Google, and Jeff Bezos,and he'd come visit meand I'd say, Time forthe scrub team, right?'Cos you know, you'vebeen with the real CEOs,and now you gotta come with me.
He's like a business father to me.
I would say, to most people, that most ofthe good things I'vebeen able to accomplish,I've learned things fromhim that have enabledthose things, and all thebad things that I've done,he gets none of theblame for any of those.
A couple of things, he raninto it for a long time,he was the CEO, and Ithink he's still the Chair,and they had a set of core values, and thefirst one was something along thelines of, it's all about the people.
So, the first and probablymost important thingI learned from Bill is, itis all about the people.
These things that we'rebuilding, these companies,these products, these businesses,it all comes down to talented people.
Getting talented peoplein a room, making surethey're aligned, gettingthe team together,and then pointing at the mountain andtaking the mountain together, that's whathe's exceptional at,and he's done it in hisown companies, and he's helped manyincredible companies do the same thing.
He was a football coach for a long time,but he's the ultimate coach in general,and I mean that term in as glorious a wayas you could mean it,he's the ultimate coach.
- [John] He doesn't geta lot of ink these days,he's a behind the scenes guy, but he'sprobably the best mentor, like, one ofthe best mentors in the world.
What he's really specialabout, is he can give youspecific situational guidance, but he alsorecognizes that you're not the same guy asEric, wasn't the sameguy as Steve, I thinkhe coaches, he sees thegenius of you, and heputs his advice and hangsthat around who you are.
- He's got, I would say,three incredible, incredibleand unique skills, the first is,he's just an incredible leader himself,an unbelievable leader himself.
His instincts are incredible, and he'ssomeone that people want to follow.
He always used to tellme, your title doesn'tmake you a leader, yourpeople make you a leader.
Being a leader is about being someone thatpeople will follow, and he'ssomeone people will follow.
So you want to soak up asmuch as you possibly can.
That's the first thing, second thing is,the guy's actually doneit, he's not a professorwho's never been in the field, he's not amanagement consultant who's helped witha few people but has never had to makethe decisions himself,this is a guy who's beenin the boiler room and has achievedtremendous success doing it, he knowsand empathizes witheverything that you haveto do as a CEO or as amanagement team member.
The third thing is,think about the companiesthat he's been around,Apple, Google, Amazon,I mean, what has he seen, he's literallyseen the history of our industry.
I don't think there'sanyone like him, no way.
- [Student] Taking astep back, what is theconversion rate of thepostcards you guys send?(laughter)- Back to growth.
- They won't let me divulge the numbers,but what I will sayis, it's not as high aswe would like it to be,but particularly in 2015,we've been able to significantly increasethe conversion rate, which then allows usto send out more postcards, because we'relooking at a cost peracquisition, and we'resort of backing into that,based on the conversion rateand so, we're verystrategic about postcards.
I'll give you two vectorsupon which we're strategic.
The first is, we don'tgive every neighborhoodthe same number ofpostcards, if a neighborhoodhas 2000 members, theneighborhood as a wholegets very few postcards,'cos it doesn't need them.
But if a neighborhoodis trying to get to 10,we may give those early people who arestarting the neighborhood 100 postcards.
That's the first thing that'sactually pretty interesting,in fact, moving into2016, I think most of ourpostcards will be going to neighborhoodsthat have fewer than 50 members.
We know from all thedata that, neighborhoodsabove 50, they're gonna grow on their own.
The second vector that'sinteresting is, we've nowbuilt a reward system, where the number ofpostcards you get asan individual is drivenby the number of acceptances frompostcards that you've sent in the past.
If we've given you 10 postcards, andyou've sent them out, and five ofyour neighbors have joined, you get more.
If we've given you 10 postcards, andyou've sent them out, and none of yourneighbors joined, youmay not get any more.
This is done on a monthlybasis, and it's actuallypretty interesting to look at the data,because the first dayof the month, we havethis giant spike in postcards sent,because there areliterally people, they wantso badly for their Nextdoor neighborhoodsto get penetrated, thatthey're waiting untilthe clock strikes midnight onthe first day of the month,and then they're sendingall their postcards out.
- Can I ask a dumb question, maybe?How do you figure out what's a reasonableCPA for a pre-monetization service?- You have to have someassumptions of, ultimately,how much you can monetize those peopleon the other end, letme just hypotheticallysay that these postcards, the CPA ended upbeing a dollar, so it's a dollar for usto use postcards to acquire members.
We should be able to generate a dollarper member in somereasonable number of time,and we've gotta backout the churn members,and we've gotta back out any other things,sort of, you can do, youcan write fiction in Excelas they say, so you've gottabe very diligent about it.
I think for us, it was acombination of thinkingabout value capture, but it was also acombination of thinkingabout value creation,which is, what is it worth to us to have80,000 neighborhoods that have launched,and how much would we pay for that?We look at it a numberof different ways, butbecause, as a management team, many of ushave laid off people, weare exceptionally carefulwith our funds, exceptionallycareful, we have to be.
- This is a really difficult,just for the record,this is a really difficultcalculus, as you can,fiction in Excel, right,you can convince yourselfof almost anything, you can justify almostany spend, (unintelligible)- I'll tell you ingeneral, as a CEO, I'm okaywith spot spending for experimentation.
If it fails, no problem,because you don't haveto do it again, the thingsthat I'm very wary of,and over-hiring is one of these people,one of these things, I'mvery wary of spendingmoney where I'm locked into spending overthe long term, without any terminal point.
When you hire someone, you're givingthat person a job, and if things work outyou want that person towork with the company foras long as possible, butif you decide to do atest where we give twice as many postcardsto some group of people, and we see whathappens, we measure the conversion,we don't have to do that next month.
I'm a big fan of taking risks, because youhave to take risks toactually have successes,but I like to bound those, I liketo be disciplined and bound them.
- Another way to saythis, structural thingsthat increase your burden are dangerous.
- Very dangerous.
- Long term leases, office space.
- Office leases areterrible, they're terrible.
In fact, today, the lastthree leases that I've signedhave been subleases,they cost a little more,but they are not longterm, and I don't knowhow to predict the sizeof the company and itssquare footage needsover a three year period.
I shouldn't be able to,because if things aregoing well, we should be growing a lot.
I'm willing to pay more per square footto not lock myself into a12 year, in San Francisconow, the landlords are lookingfor a 12 year commitment.
(laughter)And they're gettingit, they're getting it,and the math people are using it,they're saying, well,there's such a huge demandout there for office space that, even if Igrow out of this space in three years,I'll find someone elseto sublease it from me.
Well, there are two problems, one is,what if they contract, and they don't needthe space themselves, and number two,if the whole market contracts,that demand's gonna shrink.
It's smart on the landlord'spart, because they wantto lock in all the good stuffthat's happening today, butit's very dangerous forstartups, very, very dangerous.
- [Student] (unintelligible)- Sixty, probably, yeah.
- [Student] Have you had anysurprises (unintelligible)The second question is, Iappreciate the discipline ofgetting new membersnow, as you think aboutmoving into a productbase, or revenue basebeyond advertising, could we get someoverview of how you thinkabout shared services,or other forms of revenue (drowned out)- On the first, I used to tease the teambecause they would come to me initiallyand they'd say, our member is35 to 55,married, kids, and I'dsay, no no no no no!I don't want to createthat kind of productthat has that kind of narrow band.
And I thought about it, and I said, but,it sort of is the data, soyou can't dispute the data.
Ultimately, what werealized is, what was theage band of the firstmillion users of Facebook?It was, like, 17 to 21.
What's the age band today, well, I know my72 or 73 year old mom is on that thingevery single day, andso, you pick an initialmarket, and you over serve that market.
That, for us, was peoplewho own their homes,and so you have to be a little olderbecause you've generated some capitalto do it, who hadchildren, they cared aboutsafety, they cared aboutschools, those kindsof things, they wereliving in suburban areasbecause that's where you can affordhomes and send your kids to school.
That's where we saw realpenetration early on.
Here we are today, 90%plus of the neighborhoodsin the top 40 cities,there's no rhyme or reason.
We have incredible penetration in Floridasenior citizen communities, and we haveincredible penetrationin the most urban areaslike Potrero HIll in San Francisco,where you have a much younger base.
There's even someneighborhood at Stanford.
I don't know exactly what's happeningwith that neighborhood, you shouldtry to join it, I think itmight be some professors,or some folks who liveon the Stanford campus.
The hope was always that we wouldpick a group initially, andthen widen the aperture,either through product features,or just because we understoodthe needs of the users.
What it turned out happened for us is,our core value proposition,which is to speakwith your neighbors, or communicate andconnect with yourneighbors in a trusted way,that's not an age drivenvalue proposition.
It started as, it's moreimportant for a certainset of people, but it turnsout that it's marginallyimportant to everyone wholives in a neighborhood.
So now the ambition, it knows no bounds.
We believe, and we saidthis in a board meetinga couple of months ago,100% of the neighborhoodsin the country should be using Nextdoorat some point in thefuture, it shouldn't bejust the neighborhoodsthat have married people.
The second question, how dowe think about monetization?I think there'sinteresting learnings here,particularly for consumerinternet companiesthat have indirect models, where you'renot gonna ask your members to pay.
Uber and Amazon, they ask you to pay.
It's a direct transaction, you know whatyou're getting into, Google and Facebook,they're free services, andthey're monetizing through you.
Let's talk about those two as a wayof illustrating the way we think about it.
For Google, the ads, in many cases,are a part of theproduct, if you do a queryon some commercial thing, you maythink of the ads as content, and I thinkthey've even done all kinds of testingand analysis that showsthat when they removethe ads on certainqueries, trust goes down,it doesn't go up, because they're useful.
Now, let's think about Facebook, whichby the way, is a juggernaut, they're doingincredibly well, and Ihave tremendous respectin every way for what they're doing.
However, I have neverclicked on an ad on Facebook.
I've never thought tomyself, I'm going to Facebookand I hope I see an ad that I like.
They have said, we havesuch incredible scale,and they do, a billion concurrent usersin a single day, that we can just puta couple of ads in there and we can drivewhat they refer to as demand generation,whereas Google has focusedon demand fulfillment.
When you go to Google and you type in"digital camera" it'sbecause you want to buya digital camera, and they'regonna help you fulfill.
When you go to Facebook, and they show youa picture of the newest camera, and 100of your friends like it,you may actually say,cool, I want to go buy this camera.
But, that's demand generationversus demand fulfillment.
That's the way we're thinkingabout Nextdoor as well.
I'll give you a couple of examples.
I mentioned that 26% ofour use cases are aroundfinding a service provider,that's demand fulfillment.
Neighbors, does anyoneknow of a great contractor?Well, we should be able to, in a verystraightforward way, monetizethat, and we plan to.
On the other hand, real estate agents areclamoring to get into Nextdoor, becausethey either want to tell you how muchyour home is worth so you can sell it,or to tell you that there'sanother home around youthat's bigger and nicerthat you may want to buy.
But, they want to catch people who aren'tnecessarily thinkingabout buying or sellingtheir homes, in that case, it might bedemand generation for us, so we'rethinking about both of those, but I thinkthe important thing is, over half of theconversations that go on on Nextdoorare what we would call transactional.
There aren't statusupdates and photo sharing.
It's not like you come back from Hawaiiand you say, hey neighbors, look atthese killer waves that I just surfed on.
It's much more, you goto your neighbors andyou say, hey, I'm thinkingabout where to sendmy kids to school, do youguys have any feedback?If it's a private school, that's a verylarge high economic value decision.
The good news for us isthere are conversationsabout cleaning up graffiti, and aboutgetting together to have a barbeque,that aren't easily monetizable, but inGoogle's case, only 30% of the queriesare where they generate capital,and we might think ofNextdoor the same way.
That 50% that'stransactional, we wanna driveboth demand fulfillment, which isvery straightforward,but we also wanna thinkcritically about demand generation.
- [John] One more question,and then we should wrap up.
- Who, who, okay this one, right there.
- [Student] (unintelligible)- There's been a lot ofdiscussion recently abouthow do we make these conversationsas civil as possible.
Because we do requireverification, we alsoscreen out all sex offenders, becausethey're required toregister where they live,so you cannot join Nextdoorif you're a sex offender,and because of this coreintrinsic thing, which is,if you're mean to your neighbors, you maysee them in the real world the next day.
If you're mean to someoneon a message boardon the internet, and thathappens all the time,message boards arebasically, message boardsand comments tend to be cesspoolsof meanness in many cases, but it happensmuch less on Nextdoor because you haveto see these people, ifyou raised your hand,and you said something reallyinappropriate and mean,you come back to class a week fromnow, and all these people see you.
That's a different kind of regulation.
That being said, whetherit's education aroundthe right way to report criminal activity,or whether it's theneighbors talking aboutsome political issue wherethere's a disagreement,we have to remember that civility andconstructive dialogue is the waythese neighborhoods get better.
That's actually, as we think about 2016,gonna be one of our big focuses, becausebefore we had these massively penetratedneighborhoods, where there were thousandsof neighbors communicating,it was mostly all utility.
There's no bad actors when someone says,hey neighbors, do you knowof a great dog walker?That's not a good opportunity to be mean.
But in San Francisconow, if someone posts,hey, here's the ballotfor the upcoming electionon November third, and here's who I thinkwe should vote for,there's a very spiritedconversation that goes on after that,and people disagree, and that's okay.
That's good, because we want thatconversation to happen, but we want it tohappen in a constructive way, andthat's something we're focused on.
I think every large platform, Facebookwent through this a little bit, whereit was used as a platform for bullying,and sometimes it still can be, stalking,that sort of thing, any large platformthat gains scale, and Facebook is atthe very top of the list,has a responsibilitytowards making sure the conversationsand interactions are as safe and civilas possible, and we take that seriously.
- Arright, I think we'llwind up, thank you Nirav.
- Thank you guys.
