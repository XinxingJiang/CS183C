- As a quick intro,
Reed Hastings is widely
known within the Valley
as being one of the most
principled, purposeful,
rigorous in his analysis and intelligence
about being a founder and being a CEO.
He gets requests all the
time to join people's boards,
including mine eight years
ago, or whatever that was,
which he was like, "Hey,
I'm focused on education.
"Go away."
Which is a part of focus,
is one of the things that
makes Reed unusually strong.
So, we are extraordinarily
lucky to have him
with us here today.
And I think what I will
open with is another piece
of something where you are famous for,
which is the Netflix culture
and the Culture Deck.
How did the first Culture
Deck end up coming about,
getting published?
There's version two, which we'll get to,
but what led to that
creation of that deck,
the publication of it?
What was that as an act of
management, thought leadership?
- It wasn't a pre-read,
so there's no pressure on it,
but how many people have already read it?
Netflix Culture Deck.
Okay, that's fine.
Thank you.
So, about eight years ago,
we were getting tired of
new employees joining,
and I would meet with
all the new employees
and go through this 100-page slide deck.
And two out of three really
got it and understood,
and their managers had properly
described to them Netflix,
and one out of three were in shock,
because the deck had some
aggressive statements like,
"Adequate performance gets
a generous severance package,"
and "We're a team, not a family."
And so, if you know that going in,
you can love it.
But if you don't know it
and you didn't expect it,
you feel bait-and-switched.
And so the big driver was we realized
every candidate should get it,
and that, of course, if every
candidate's gonna get it,
it's gonna be public,
so let's just make it public.
- Was the construction of
it a way to essentially,
as you're doing scale to
kind of keep a cultural norm
as you scaled?
Was that one of the central
tools for doing that?
- Yes.
I wouldn't quite say keep a cultural norm,
but it was to share and debate.
One of the great things about
putting things in writing
is that it makes it more debatable,
and so it's not just hearing
a sermon and it's like,
"Okay, that's nice,"
but you can comment on,
"You know, this part here
that we wrote down doesn't
really seem appropriate,
or doesn't seem what we do."
To some degree it's a bill
of rights for employees,
which is "Here's a set of
things that we, the company,
want to and aspire to operate by,
and if we don't,
you can call us on it."
And then we'll either fix
the articulation because
it's too easy to misunderstand,
or live up to what we want to.
So, in some ways it's aspirational,
and then by putting it in writing,
which probably started
five years before that,
it allows all the people in the company
to collaborate on it and
to suggest improvements.
- And what other things do you do
to keep a healthy culture at scale?
What are the other kind of techniques
in addition to the deck,
in addition of the on-boarding?
- Yeah I would say in our
first couple of years,
so we're founded about
20 years ago in '97,
to when we went public in 2002,
all we were concerned with
is not going bankrupt,
because the first big
internet recession was 2001,
and so we had built up a big expense rate
contingent on future financing.
NASDAQ fell 75% that year,
and all the venture capitals
felt over-leveraged.
They were barely gonna be able to support
their existing investments.
Certainly no one wanted
to take on new ones.
The year before, in 2000,
to raise money was as easy
as taking a tin can and shaking it
and like $50,000,000
would show up in the can.
It was incredible.
I've never seen anything
like it until last year.
And then the following
year after the crash,
you take your tin can out and shake it,
and someone would steal the can.
So, it was an enormously
sharp and short change,
which is why you see so much
talk today about bubble.
No one cares about the bubble,
they care about the fall.
So, suddenly we didn't have enough money,
we had to lay off a third
of the company in 2001,
and we eked into profitability
and survived.
But until that point,
we really spent all the time just on
how are we gonna get the business to be,
we were DVD by mail at the time.
So, it was, how is it gonna be profitable?
And only after 2002 we realized,
"Wow, we're gonna survive."
Then we started to think,
"Wow, it would be awful
to not want to work here,
so we should try to figure
out what cultural attributes
were there of what we wanted to work in."
We didn't set out to try to say,
"What's the most theoretically
efficient culture?"
in some abstract sense,
it was literally about us,
and we realized that what we valued most,
even more than success,
was working with really talented
people in a productive way.
That that joy of
excellence was incredible.
And of course if you can get
that joy of people excellence
and talent density,
then you're very likely to win.
So, they come together,
but at the core it was
about having dense talent.
And part of it was,
after we did this one third layoff,
it was 120 people to 80,
we had expected to
basically grind to a halt
and really not be able
to make any improvements,
cause it would take 80 people
just to keep the lights on.
But, in fact, we got more
done with only 80 people,
and we tried to figure out why.
And we realized now there was
no dummy-proofing necessary,
and so it was just
everybody was going fast
and everything was right.
And so, we realized with
the right density of talent,
there's very little process needed,
and that that was the joyful thing.
So, at first we said,
"Let's do a one third layoff every year."
That that was the key.
- That's a long-term winning strategy.
- That's a long-term winning, it might be.
Back to the blitzscaling thing.
And then we realized.
- Shrinking, we're gonna now add.
- Blitz shrinking.
Well, you want your gross heads to be 100%
and just your net adds are less.
But talent density matters so much.
So, then we figured,
"No, let's not do a layoff
every year like that.
Let's just do continued focus."
And the big evolution we
came to is for managers,
they have to each year testify
for each of their people
that if that person were trying to quit,
they would try to change their mind.
And so, it's up to the manager to decide,
"Yes, I would want to change their mind,"
but sometimes you find that
you have people working for you
and if they quit you'd be like,
"That's pretty good."
And that's the case that
we wanted to proactively,
not wait for them to quit,
but proactively give them a
generous severance package.
- Yeah, and that's how I
come to the Culture Deck.
In addition to performance,
cause this is,
actually I'm to some degree,
leading the witness on this
or leading the question,
but what were the key things
about establishing that culture
which enabled you to scale?
Because this is the highly-aligned,
loosely-coupled part of your
version two of the deck.
- So, I think when we went public
we were 150 people by then,
and people worried internally.
Now that we're public,
everything's gonna go to shit,
because so many companies had done that:
put in a lot of process,
be very cautious, etc.
And we've made great progress
really every year of pushing back on that
and doing something
either symbolic or real
that increased employee freedom.
Essentially incented more
variance in what we're doing,
and we realized if we're
gonna run really loose,
like very little rules,
then you do want to set a broad context.
So, we set context,
and this is what Reid's referring to,
which is we added essentially
a chapter to our Slide Deck,
which is "Context, Not Control."
And so, we try to get managers to inspire
and lead people rather
than micromanage them,
and they inspire and lead them
through setting the context.
"What are we trying to do?
What are the constraints?
Is it a really big problem
or a little problem?
Must be done right, or we
do an approximate version
and fix later?"
There's a lot of context
to any problem area.
And if you get good at setting context,
than you don't have to
direct the micro-specifics.
But it's an art.
So, there's context about the problem,
and then there's context about behavior,
which is really the culture.
Which is, "what are the behavioral norms
in terms of honesty and
sharing and forthrightness?"
- And in terms of setting the context,
one of the things when I read,
we've actually never talked about
the version two of the deck,
and when I read that and
compared and contrast
and looked at it, I was like,
"Alright well one of the key
things is people usually want
command and control."
And you have an exemptions
slide on the control,
but people usually wanna
be able to do something,
like a bold new innovation
usually requires somebody going,
"This is my idea, I'm driving it home."
How does setting the context
and that kind of innovation,
how do those line up and
what do you do about that?
- Well, I think you might be mixing,
the manager shares a lot of context,
but a lot of people make decisions.
We definitely have decision owners.
There's almost nothing by consensus,
but you gotta know the context
and then you make decisions
and a lot of things happen
that I don't even know about,
about different deals or
different things or hiring.
You guys are gonna get lucky
and meet with Marisa in a week or two,
and one of the things that saddened me
when she went to Yahoo,
which was very brave of her to do,
was this idea that she was
gonna review every resumé
to raise the bar on hiring.
And to me that's a suicidal methodology
for a senior executive because
you got a thousand people
and you're so tactically buried trying
to do a thousand resumés.
And I think what she was going for,
and you can ask her,
is a symbol of, "I care
about the details."
A better way, there are
better ways to do symbols.
I don't review resumés,
I don't block hires.
I look at it as my job is
to evangelize the benefits
of super-great talent density.
But we don't even try to hire perfectly,
because when you are interviewing,
it's six or eight hours with someone.
It's something,
but you know them so much better
after they've been in for three months,
so I'm like,
"If you have an instinct
you wanna try, try."
Take the person in.
If it doesn't work out,
we'll give them the severance package
and we'll move on
and it's not the end of the world.
So, we're experimental
with people in the same way
you might be experimental
with a product feature
or something.
And it's important to be honest
with a person when you're doing that.
But we don't look at it as a marriage.
There's no need to,
and that's essentially an
adaptation to the growth.
- Well, actually I think
what Marissa's trying to do
a little bit, because we had Eric in here
a couple of weeks ago.
Three weeks ago.
Anyway and part of what
Eric was expressing
about how they built
the Google culture was,
"You guys should only hire
people with certain kinds
of degrees from certain
kinds of Universities,"
where they were actually, in fact,
reviewing every resumé, every CD before.
I think she's like, "Okay, we gotta get
to that kind of setting of the bar."
And that actually kind of
leads naturally to one of the.
- But that's mistaken in so many ways.
First of all, it's trying
to do it the Google way,
which even, anyway.
- Well, that's precisely the
question I was getting to,
which is there are other attempts
at building strong cultures.
Google is one of them.
How would you kind of compare and contrast
so people understand that there isn't just
Netflix is the only strong culture,
but here is some way of understanding
the variances between strong cultures?
- Well, I think the key thing,
and it's a great point,
is there are many different cultures,
and as long as you're really
clear about your culture,
you can get the employees
who love that culture.
And not everyone will be the same fit.
There are some things, like integrity,
that are pretty universal.
But there are other things
of how to deal with dissent,
where there's perfectly
reasonable different ways
and effective different
ways of dealing with things.
So, the literature on
culture is pretty clear
that strong cultures work,
and weak cultures are diffused.
So, in a weak culture,
it's really a diverse culture.
You get many people
acting very differently,
and then they don't understand each other
and they feel undercut and political.
Even in a, let's take a Hollywood studio
that many of you would
not like to work in,
they have a very clear
system of how to operate
in terms of how they manage the politics,
and it's internally consistent.
And everybody knows it
and the people who get good at it love it,
and a lot of people don't.
It's not inherently awful or ineffective,
it just wasn't right, say, for us.
So, that's why I think
culture is an expression
of what you and your
senior team want to be.
It's a bit aspirational in that way.
- Is part of the interviewing process,
do you have essentially a culture check?
- Yes, but not like a checklist.
Culture is always something
that we interview for
of kind of curiosity.
It's easy to find people who say,
"Oh, I've read the Netflix Culture Deck.
I love it, I really wanna be there."
What's harder is,
"What are the main things
you disagree with and why?"
When we get a blank stare, we're like,
"Okay, not really a
first principle thinker."
And when they say,
"Well, I thought the way
that you didn't talk
about how to acculturate,"
and "if I'm not great
on day three, am I out
or do you look at it like an athlete
where it's over some time
period to prove yourself?
And if so, what's that time period,
and why haven't you clarified that?"
Then, we're like "Oh, yeah
that's a good insight."
First principle thinker.
So, we're looking for
people who are curious,
typically self-confident,
and they're questioning
everything around them.
- Last culture question before we move on
to some of the other kind
of interesting lessons from Netflix,
missions.
So, I think you can only
have a strong culture
when you actually have a
mission in the company.
How do you define the Netflix mission,
and how is that kind of
embodied in the strategy,
in the work-play?
- Well, I would say I've always believed
that a strong mission
statement is really important,
and I have to say we've
never succeeded at it.
It's like this odd thing.
We've had them every year for 15 years,
and they're constantly different,
and now we're all so cynical.
We're like, "Come on, we're
trying to make people happy."
I mean, that's the fundamental
thing in consumer service.
We're trying to be better,
and us and Disney and mission
aren't that different.
There's a bunch of
different tactics at it,
but we're an emotional product.
We cater to the things that are
important but not necessary,
and I love that part about it,
cause when you're selling
milk or penicillin,
you're selling something somebody needs
and we get to sell something you want
that you choose to do
because it's really human
to be entertained and connect
to people over entertainment.
And so, we celebrate that a lot
and we want to change the industry,
but in terms of a mission statement
like so many companies have,
Facebook talks about a more
connected and open world,
and then you see that phrase
again and again and again,
and it's a powerful mantra.
We don't have an equivalent
and I think we probably
would've been stronger if we do.
In the early days it was to connect people
with movies they'll love.
And it's okay, but it's kind of like
a long, kind of awkward phrase,
"Connect people with movies they'll love."
It's just not punchy.
We used it, we had t-shirts.
And then it didn't really motivate anyone.
It didn't really stick.
But we knew we were trying
to make people happy with DVD's.
And then, eventually it was
streaming and original content.
So, it didn't hold us back much.
- So, let's go on to some
of the lessons from Netflix.
So, if you were to call a
younger version of yourself
and tell yourself to do,
what key lessons that you would do
differently through Netflix,
through the history of Netflix.
Obviously, you've been a founder
of companies before Rational et cetera.
But what were the key lessons you would,
"This is an inflection thing that
I wish I had done differently?"
- We went public in 2002,
growing nicely in '03 and '04,
and Blockbuster which then
was 20 times larger than us,
finally counter-attacked and in a.
- I'm just curious, how
many people, raise your hand
if you know what Blockbuster is.
- Oh, they know what it is (laughs).
- It's not quite.
- [Reed] A more accurate question was,
"Do you remember actually renting a DVD?
And Redbox is still quite popular.
In '03 and '04, we're growing really fast.
'05 Blockbuster attacks.
And so we thought we were very clever.
We came up with a number
of ways to counter-attack,
and remember that
everybody's got every DVD,
so Blockbuster and us had
the same content offering,
cause it's non-exclusive
licensing to get DVDs.
So we could differentiate.
On our service, fulfillment
levels were 99%,
and theirs were 89.
But that's a really
abstract for a customer,
thinking of signing up
doesn't mean anything, right?
And then they discounted massively,
so it's like half our price.
And so, we were losing share.
So we were struggling
with what to do about it.
So we did three or four big efforts.
One is in the end of '05
we added Netflix Friends,
which was our own social network.
Remember in '05 Facebook's
just on a few universities.
So our own social network
amongst our members,
and if you enabled each other,
you could see what each other
were renting and rating.
And we thought,
"Wow, the viral effects of
this would be really powerful,"
et cetera.
We added ad sales.
Back in the day it was
like Yahoo type banners,
and we sold banners
above the choosing interface.
We added used DVD sales
on our site to consumers.
Of course we had some excess
DVDs from four years ago,
so we added an operation to
sell them for four bucks a pop.
It's a different logistics,
but we added all that.
And we added Red Envelope Entertainment,
which was a group that we brought in
to buy films out of Sundance
and similar festivals
to then publish them on DVDs,
so getting into content.
So we did these four efforts.
And each one was a
dozen people, 15 people,
and made us feel great.
Employees loved them because
here was a tangible thing
that was not just 98% versus 89%.
Here was the thing that they
couldn't do or weren't doing,
and it was a differentiator, right?
And wasn't management so clever?
We went through these waves
of battles in '06 and '07,
and in the end we won.
They ended up closing
down their online thing,
and two years later going
completely bankrupt.
But we looked back and
none of those four efforts
made any contribution to our victory.
And one by one, we had closed
them down along the way,
every single one of those four.
And so, in hindsight, we
realized when attacked,
we should retreat to do the core better
and not try to broaden the
surface of attack, essentially.
And it was a great lesson for us of focus,
So now when people say,
"Aren't you getting into news or sports?"
we're like, "Absolutely not,"
and we're really confident in our answer.
Movies and T.V. shows on a global basis,
enormous market.
And so we're much less
subject to being prone
to go off and chase the shiny object
to try to have something in
the checklist to differentiate,
and to trust.
And in hindsight if we had just gone
from 98% perfect to 99.9%,
we would've done a lot
more for the business.
And it's hard work.
It's operational logistics,
how to get DVDs not to break,
the amount of polycarbonate
analysis we had to do,
it was all this stuff.
We would've beaten Blockbuster
sooner than we did.
And so that's one of the great
lessons out of that time.
- What about a Qwikster?
- Yeah, Qwikster we got
some lessons out of.
So, I'll give you some context.
Now that we're growing, '07, '08, '09,
we're adding streaming,
it's a hybrid plan,
you've got DVDs and streaming.
'010 we launch in Canada
as a test, in a way,
of both international and streaming only,
cause there's no DVDs.
And we expected x and we
got 10x bigger reaction
and customer signups than we expected.
I mean, it was just massive
even though it was just
streaming, no DVDs,
and we realized, "Oh my God.
"You don't need DVDs."
- Wasn't that part of the
plan from the beginning?
- Well, we were always gonna
use them as a hybrid way.
This was our differentiator against Hulu,
because Hulu was about
equal size at the time.
"But we have DVDs too."
That's our differentiator.
"We're streaming and DVDs."
Which was gonna be compelling,
was compelling to half the market,
but was gonna be compelling
to a shrinking percentage
of the market every year.
So, it's not what you want
your brand image to be around,
so we realized,
"Wow, we cannot afford to use the crutch
of DVD now because pure streaming works
and so we wanna win as the best
place to do pure streaming,
not be the best place to do hybrid,
because that wasn't a long-term benefit."
So, we had to not rely on DVD.
So, I think correctly, we
separated the two businesses.
The huge mistake we made,
because remember, in 2010
we're in the middle of a
recession still pretty deep,
as we said,
"Well, $8 is a good
price for the DVD plan,
it's a good price for the streaming plan,
so the combination, which
is $16, is the new price."
And the old price was 10 bucks.
So from the customer standpoint,
one day the price went up 60%
in the middle of a recession,
and now they had to deal
with two user interfaces instead of one.
So, this was not well regarded,
and if we had done
grandfathering on the price
for a couple of years
it would've been fine.
Now, fortunately we realized,
"Wow, we've got to make amends."
But now a lot of people have left us
and changing the price would be hard,
but the symbol of Qwikster was much hated
even though the name
tested quite positively
before we did this,
it had attracted a lot of negative.
So, if we killed the symbol,
maybe people would forgive us.
And so that's why we killed Qwikster.
And people mostly forgave
us and we moved on.
- And one of the things
I learned from that,
from you when you were doing that,
is I actually thought that
your letter to the public
on the blog was actually masterfully done.
It was personal, it was open.
Was that just a natural
reflex as part of leadership
to write that kind of letter and make it
as an open statement about,
"Look, we need to over-communicate,
we need to be humble,"
or was that something
that kind of was a result
of a ton of internal discussion about how
to do crisis management?
- Well, I think everyone
who has both Oxford
and Stanford degrees loved that letter.
- Oh.
(audience laughs)
So, I loved that letter.
- Yes.
No, in hindsight
it actually was a very bone-headed move
for your typical consumer (laughs)
because it was.
- New lesson.
- It was an explanation
of basically why we needed
to do this thing and
they didn't really care.
It was about our survival,
blah, blah, blah.
So there was a few more people
than just you that liked it,
but by and large
it was tone-deaf consumer marketing,
because they didn't hate the letter,
it had some positives of being authentic,
but it just stirred things up.
And a better thing would've just been
to change the situation
i.e. Qwikster or whatever,
as opposed to get into these.
It's just too intellectual.
- So, if streaming wasn't
part of the initial plan,
what was the initial plan?
Was it just DVDs?
- No, streaming was.
In '87 I took Tannenbaum's
networking class here,
and I don't know if they
still use the same textbook
or some adaptation of it,
but you have to calculate the
bandwidth of a station wagon
filled with backup tapes
driving across the country.
And of course it turns out
to be terabits per second
and it's got a high latency, three days,
to get any bit to the east coast.
But it's super efficient
digital distribution network.
And in '97 when someone showed me DVD,
it was the first time I had seen it,
I was like, "Oh my God,
that's the station wagon.
That's five gigabytes on
this one ounce plastic disc,
and I'll bet you can mail that."
And there's my network,
there's my station wagon.
And so, we always conceived of DVD by mail
as a digital distribution
network with high latency.
And someday we'd use the
internet to take the latency out.
And early internet was more expensive
to deliver five gigs than mail.
It only took another three
of four years of Moore's Law
to make that cross over.
But we always conceived
of DVD as temporary,
internet streaming as the long-term.
- Was there anything in the initial plan
that turned out to be radically wrong
that your engagement
with the market changed?
- Yeah in '97 when we were
first seeking funding,
we thought it would be mostly
streaming in five years,
by 2002.
And in 2002, there was nothing.
It was still dial-up.
AOL was, the company was in trouble,
but dial-up was still king.
And so, around then said
by within five years,
streaming will be half our business.
And by 2007 it was still zero.
So we said once more the next five years
it's gonna be half our business.
And we were wrong but the other way.
The next five years it was like 60%.
So we just kept repeating the same thing,
and eventually it turned out right.
- Yeah, one of the things that I sometimes
like to say about predictions is
the only prediction about the future
that is generally true
is that most predictions
of the future are false,
but it's the paradoxes.
A number of people here
are actually entrepreneurs,
some of them are applying
at certain companies.
Is there anything in the financing process
for early Netflix,
lessons you learned that you would redo
like in terms of how
you ran the financing?
- More relevant, I think.
I graduated in '88.
Worked at a research lab,
worked at a networking company,
worked at a startup that failed
where I was just a hardcore engineer.
And then I had an idea.
And you really want to do
the entrepreneurial thing
when you have the right idea.
There's no point of deciding,
"I'm gonna do it this year
with the best idea I've got."
You're probably gonna have crap results.
And so it's when some idea
is just shaking you so hard
that you'll go into poverty
to see that idea materialized.
And the idea is really important to you.
And then you change your life
to become an entrepreneur
to do the idea.
And so the concept or whatever
it is that you have has to,
and it's good to constantly
be thinking about
what could that concept be,
but I would approach it that way.
So, my first company was funded.
20 people, 20k a piece.
So broader family and
friends and angel round.
Only one or two semi-professional.
No one close to Sam Altman
or someone like that.
It was a little less
developed 20 years ago
in the ecosystem.
On that money, we were
able to launch a product,
get some initial traction,
and then we got our first venture capital,
which was the predecessor to
Benchmark, Merill Pickard,
and Mayfield.
And that worked out, I
would say, very well.
We got people that we
trusted and really helped us
grow the business.
So I had an enormously positive
venture capital experience
in that way.
And what you realize is
many third party vendors
and banks and things,
they will screw with your company
because they don't really care.
But they care a lot about their reputation
with your board members.
And your board members,
when they're venture capitalists,
become the guarantor that
you won't get screwed with.
At least, much less anyway.
Because their long-term reputation
is with your board members,
not with you, typically.
And so that's a big, subtle value add.
In Netflix's case, I can self-fund,
I had done well enough
on the first company
which got sold in '97 that I self-funded
the first couple of rounds.
So it's not relevant, probably,
for a typical situation.
In hindsight, we wish
we had done more debt
and less equity, and you
know the cardinal things.
- The prediction from success.
- Yes, that's right.
Nothing too dramatic.
- How about your first hires?
How would you think about,
cause you've now done this twice,
both times successfully.
Once massively successfully.
How do you think about the
first five to ten people?
How do you think about doing that hiring?
How do you run it?
- It's people you wanna work with,
but you can't be afraid to change.
You can't let friendship get in the way
of professional judgement.
So, you've always gotta be thinking,
"Do I have the right team?"
and, "I owe it to the whole
team, to the marketplace,
to my investors, to myself,
to do what I think is the
right thing for the company."
And when I was first a CEO,
I'd never managed anyone,
so I'd never written a review
for anyone or anything,
because I was an individual engineer.
I found a lot of those
communication things difficult,
and in particular I couldn't
possible fire someone.
It felt so cruel, it felt inhuman.
It's like breaking up with
a girlfriend or boyfriend
or something, but worse.
It felt awful because it was selfish.
So, it took me probably three years before
I came to a view that I had.
And the rest of the company
was depending on me,
to do the right thing.
And that it wasn't about me being selfish
and pushing the person out,
it was about me protecting the company.
And once I could neutralize
the value scales that way,
I could comfortably say to someone,
"I'm sorry for this, but I
think it's best for the company
if we end your employment."
And once it was, "And I think
it's best for the company,"
I could get there.
Now, many of you are
probably more sophisticated,
more mature, you've broken up
with more partners (laughter)
so it's easier for you,
cause it just takes practice.
We don't get enough practice in that.
- Actually, there's a book
I recommend to people,
which I don't know if you've encountered,
by Fred Kofman called
"Conscious Business."
And I'll get you a copy, but
it's actually very similar
which is thinking about compassion
and compassion management.
The compassion is not
only to the individual,
the compassion is to the company.
The compassion is to the customers.
The compassion to the shareholders.
You actually have to
integrate all that compassion,
and once you're doing that,
that actually makes the,
"Oh, yeah I understand
this is painful for you,
but actually, in fact, it's
still a compassionate act."
And that was actually
one of the things I found
really good in how Fred
thinks about these things.
- Yeah, and I think one part of compassion
is a severance package,
because when you cut someone loose
and it's a week or two of pay,
it really can be difficult for them,
but our minimum is four months
and it goes up from there.
So, even if two weeks in we realize
there's a mistake,
as long as the person hasn't
lied to us or something
but we've made a mistake,
they get a four month severance package.
And that does a couple of things.
One, it makes the person
feel better about it
cause they know it's a
material amount of money.
And again, four months is the minimum.
And two, we get a legal
release in exchange for that.
And so despite the fact
that we've separated from
a thousand people, maybe,
we've never had an employee lawsuit,
because of this.
And then third and most subtly,
managers are really nice people.
They're human beings and
they're good with people,
so they don't like doing mean things.
And so, you can think
of the severance payment
as a bribe to the manager
to do the right thing,
because it makes it easier.
And without that, what they do
is they put an employee on a
performance improvement plan,
and then the two of them go
through this excruciating dance
where it takes two or
three or four months,
and then they break up but
it's clearly documented.
And that's just a lot worse.
So, that's why we avoid that.
And essentially we buy out
and then the person's good.
They'll take a month or two off,
and then they'll get snapped up somewhere.
- When did you start with the
four month severance package?
- It was three months
from the very beginning,
- That's unusual for a startup.
- Yes.
It's real money,
but it's worth it,
because again, otherwise the person,
it's costing you anyway.
It doesn't really cost you any more,
because you're going to
spend the three months
managing the person out,
and so you're gonna end up with that hit.
It's kind of a classic.
- All right, so let's...
actually, no.
One thing.
Has your hiring changed as you scaled?
Like your hiring practices?
Cause you're very familiar
with all blitzscaling pieces
of how all these things change
at each different magnitude.
Was there anything notable
when you look back at hiring
that you said, "Oh, these
are things we added in
as we got to larger scales?"
- No, I would say we have a very big
people judgement process.
Some companies try to standardize
and put a lot of
statistics and analysis in,
and we've never believed in that.
We say, about data, use a lot of data
when you're picking stocks,
but probably don't use a lot of data
in picking a spouse.
That the more that you're
in an emotional element
and a gut feel element,
the less useful data is.
And the more you want to really listen
to your intuition and judgement.
So, we spent a lot of time with candidates
trying to get them to talk and feel,
but then we don't do like
a how-long-did-it-take analysis,
or I don't know.
Something like that.
And then, we do a lot on references.
I'm always stunned how many companies
don't do good references
and how many employees that
I don't get called about.
And I'm like, "Really?
"You didn't even call?"
And so, we're manic on, and always blind.
I mean, we never even ask
the person for references.
There's this great tool,
LinkedIn, (laughter)
and so you can find the reference.
That has changed the game in references.
- So, let's go to some of the areas
where Netflix has done
some very interesting,
and actually unique strategies that,
as far as I can tell no
one else ever did them,
and there may be additional ones
to the ones I'm about to ask you about.
Bu let's start with the prize
for the recommendation algorithm.
Where you kind of said, "Okay,
this is one of the most
important parts of our business.
Which other movies would you also see?
How do we essentially
crowdsource and get network
intelligence for the best possible ideas.
Let's do a prize."
How was that conceived?
How did it work?
Would you do it again?
Would you do it differently?
- I'll tell you the story of it,
but unforunately it's disappointing
because it turns out that we did one,
it was epic, and we've never
been able to do another.
So, it's not like a general purpose thing
that you can use a lot.
Once in a while,
there's a problem that is
amenable to outside analysis.
That one was.
We hit the right tones on it,
it was transformative for
Netflix in the machine-learning
community in 2007,
and really helped move things up a notch.
And still today we get
residual goodwill from it.
And so of course we want to
do prize two and prize three
and prize four,
and we still have not found
even a single other one problem
that was amenable to that kind
of formalized architecture.
So, very specialty, exotic
tool as you grow companies.
- And say a little bit
about how you did the tool.
Is there anything you would've changed?
I understand it's rare.
And then, what you got out of it.
- I didn't say it was an open contest.
We put out a data set, and it's
like, "Crack this data set.
to this, reducing the root mean
squared error by 10%."
And you could submit these attempts,
because you're doing new
algorithms like in that,
but you can think of it like
cracking a cryptographic thing,
or any of those like pay for
bug bounties is a good one
that people do
as an example of a crowdsource one.
But again, there are these little pockets
where it's a workable solution.
- Did you end up getting
a better algorithm,
or did you end up getting
mostly better goodwill?
- Much bigger benefit in goodwill.
Some benefit, the algorithm
worked and we put it in place,
but then we grew past it.
So, it wasn't like a
permanent step function,
it was a one-time.
- So, now let's go to original content.
This is probably one of the things
that's probably most stunned most classic
Silicon Valley people because
we think we're good at tech.
That's what the talent base here is.
We're bad at content programming,
that's what you go down to L.A. for.
It's the kind of thing
where intensely engineering
and technology driven culture
will be intrinsically bad at this,
because we'll be bad at people,
we'll be bad at emotions.
And so when you start doing this,
I think the general kind
of "received wisdom"
in the Valley was, "Oh, that's a mistake."
And then, of course, you pull it out,
you do it much more successfully than
Amazon, also doing it.
And then later a following.
And then other folks.
What led to the strategy?
Why is it that you just literally
trounced conventional wisdom on this?
What were the lessons from that?
- I say Amazon is doing
a pretty reasonable job
but we can come to that.
Necessity is a mother of invention.
Every cable network.
FX, AMC, HBO,
started on other people's content
and then got some scale in distribution.
And then went into doing
their own original content.
So the path for Netflix
was well understood
like other cable networks.
So it wasn't like,
"Oh my God we never thought about this"
kind of thing.
You get more differentiation
and love and value
from if you did the content well.
Again we tried it early
in 2005 on a DVD basis.
We only had five million subscribers.
And the economics were roughly for a movie
like we got those cool Maggie
Gyllenhaal movie at Sundance.
We would have normally bought,
suppose Sony Classics had bought the film.
We would have bought 20,000 DVD's at $20.
So $400,000.
But instead now we can buy
the film for $2 million
and put $2 million to marketing it.
So we had ten times the cost.
And we still didn't need
more than 20,000 DVD's.
We're like,
"Wow this sucks."
(crowd laughs)
Ten times as much!
And meanwhile Sony
bought some other movie,
made it popular enough with our members,
and we still had to buy the 20,000.
So we didn't really save anything right?
And we realized,
"We're just not nearly at scale."
And we got out of it.
And then in 2010,
we were spending enough
on the big-ticket TV shows
from a licensing standpoint
that my partner Ted Sarandos,
who lives in L.A. said,
"Now is the time."
And we were like,
"Oh my God are you crazy?"
We're gonna put a $100
million that was like
a quarter of the content budget.
And he was like,
"Don't worry I've negotiated.
We don't have to pay for it till 2013."
(laughs)
- Don't worry the bill
will come to you later.
- The bill will come to you later.
It's due on arrival.
I'm like,
"Oh yeah I feel great now."
Man it was transformative.
So he picked incredibly for what we need
and I don't get any credit for that.
That was all him.
And now Ted's built a team
from studios that are cherry pickings.
Some of the best people out of CBS, NBC,
to do exactly that.
And they really know how to run shows.
And the main thing is
the cultural attributes
that we talked about before,
context not control,
freedom and responsibility.
Those have played extremely
well in our relations
with the show runners,
with the producers.
And so it's been a very consistent model.
And it turns out that really
our culture is designed
at inspiring and
motivating creative people
and you can create a software person.
Create a marketer.
Create a content producer.
It's really in the creative world.
And the creative world the hallmark is,
"You do your best thinking in the shower."
You have a huge idea.
The day after Thanksgiving
on a mountain bike ride
trying to recover.
It's not like you need eight, ten,
12, 15 hours in the office
doing something because
in the creative community
it's synthesizing all of these things.
And that's true in a number of fields.
- And is this,
was the cost reason the reason you did?
Cause I think all of
your original content's
been TV shows not movies.
Or is it most?
- Most.
We just had a big one,
"Beasts of No Nation"
was our first big movie.
And then we have one with Brad Pitt
next year called "War Machine."
- And was the reason
because of the cost of TV?
The reason you focused on TV?
Or was there a different
reason to initially focus on
TV and then build there?
- The economics of TV are much better
and there's too much capital
chasing movies because
of it's historic legacy.
So the returns and the movie business
are just much harder to make money.
Yes, TV's less expensive
per hour typically,
but not for any inherent reason.
Just cause that's what other people spend.
So to be as good as them,
that's all you have to spend.
So it's really influx of capital.
And then of course when you
fall in love with the show,
then there's a built-in
market for season two.
So that's a great thing.
- And how is the original
content playing now?
What are the current things that are
knocking out of the park?
What have you learned from them?
- Huge hit right now,
"Master of None"
anybody seen it?
A couple, the rest of you
have got to go see it.
I'm telling you.
Watch the first two or three episodes.
Aziz Ansari and it's
his commentary on life.
And it's unbelievably funny.
And he casts his parents in it
and gets away with it.
And it's both warm and delicious,
and biting
and hugely original.
So that's our current one.
"Narcos" was a big one this summer.
Which was American company
us contracting with
Gaumont which is the oldest film
producing company in the world.
It's a French company.
Filming in Bogota, Colombia
with Brazilian talent,
and it's super popular in Germany.
(crowd laughs)
- It's defined globalism.
- That's right, and so this
is why Netflix is racing
to get as global as quickly as possible.
We want to produce
content all over the world
to share with the world.
And so it's not a Hollywood to the world,
it's really connecting great stories.
- Is there anything
that when you look back
at Netflix you think
was a kind of a strategy
that you pioneered that we didn't cover,
that would be useful for the students?
- Once you're public,
which would be a great day,
you're gonna have an issue
around stockholder utility
and stock comp options and RSU's.
That really frustrates people because
most of our company stocks
are pretty volatile.
And then if the stock goes down,
people feel cheated.
So I think the mechanism,
if you get to that stage,
look up how Netflix does
stock options because
it's from my experience in
the first company Purisoft
with dealing with that
volatility that we did a
big adaptation in Netflix.
So I think works much better.
And it's basically price averaging
if you follow stock markets.
- So let's switch to a little bit of the,
kind of the classic role of a job.
Of the role of a CEO.
How do you define the role of the CEO?
- That definitely varies
by stage and company.
In the first couple of
years you do everything.
You're doing dishes at night.
You're coding,
maybe you're writing
marketing materials for sure,
you're dealing with
customers and investors,
and you have so many
disadvantages as an irrelevant
little nothing as a
company that you have to
make up for it with talent and
hard work and brute force.
And so if you're lucky,
that's only a couple of years
as opposed to ten years
where you're just on call constantly
in a very intense way.
And then the trick is
as you get to 50, 100 people
you've got to evolve your management style
as you get to 500 people.
Kind of each 10x,
maybe even just five x you've got to adapt
to be more strategic because it used to be
you knew every person
and now you don't.
So now you gotta manage
a little bit differently
and still you wanna be a great leader
for those people.
When you get to real scale,
most of what I do is
vision about what markets
we should be in.
Like we should go global,
we should do originals.
But I'm not picking countries
and I'm not picking shows.
Vision of we should spend 5%
or 10% of revenue on marketing
as opposed to 50% or 2%.
So some big macro decisions like that.
But not what's the campaign.
So there's vision there.
There's vision in terms of culture.
What are the rules of the road
of how the firm operates?
What's our character?
So that it's a healthy place.
Vision, focus, inspiration.
But you really,
you can't do much of the work because
it's just too big.
So if you tried to,
you're laboring yourself out
and getting everyone else upset.
In my first company it was
probably a more relevant
example for all of you.
I was 33.
The company's growing about 50 people,
and I was still trying to coat it.
We had 50 people.
I was still writing product at night,
and then trying to be CEO at day
and sleeping at work.
And I wasn't careful enough
about taking showers.
And finally someone said to me,
"Shower!",
(crowd laughs)
and it's just gross.
We don't want our leader to be gross.
We get that you're working hard.
And by the way,
when there's bugs in your coat,
it's really hard.
- It's a different definition of culture.
- It's really hard to get
you to fix things because
you're off doing other things.
And so I was trying to hold on too long
to the dual roles.
- And so how do you improve
your ability as CEO?
How do you learn?
How do you be on a constant improvement?
- In my first company,
I think I made a mistake
and I felt like investing
in me was sort of selfish.
I should be working.
And so I got invited to YPO
which is Young Presidents Organization,
and it's a good learning type paradigm.
And I looked at it a little,
but I was like,
"It's like a day a month.
I can't take a day a month off of work."
And for me it was like off of work.
And in hindsight that was a
real mistake cause I didn't.
I was too busy chopping
wood to sharpen the axe.
As of later state CEO,
you need the skills and personal maturity
and growth and reflection
and I should have cross-fertilized.
I should have spent more time
with other entrepreneurs,
seeing how other people do it,
learn and invest in myself.
Maybe that's do more yoga or do meditation
or be more.
It's like that great Gandhi quote about
"Oh my God I've got so much to do.
I've got to meditate for at
least two hours this morning."
I didn't have that perspective.
Really until that company sold,
and then I did a wonderful thing that
Reid Hoffman also did
being a crown fellow.
I didn't understand that
connection that by making myself
better both as a person and a leader,
I was actually helping the company
even though I was away from work.
And it sounds so obvious to say it,
but I just didn't give
myself permission to do that.
- Is there anything you
encounter cause one of the things
you also have a general
reputation for is a deep certainty
of conviction of belief.
Have the things that you
encountered as CEO caused
you to question yourself?
- I would say that's not
an accurate attribution.
It may come across that way,
but I'm very much like Hank Paulson
and you can never know anything for sure.
Maintaining a reservoir of
doubt is really important.
We often try to do the
exercise like at Netflix.
You're 18 months with doing exercise,
what would be different in Netflix
if you were CEO?
And it's a way for me to
gather all the things.
And some people say,
"They've changed the pricing.
If we do this different we
would be in the ad business."
And then I really try to think through.
A lot of "Would I really do that?
Am I sure?
How confident am I?"
We call it farming for dissent.
You're constantly,
you can never be confident of anything.
You want to constantly be curious,
and yet you have to be
executing really firmly
so it's a little bit like your lovely
Isaiah Berlin piece of
simultaneously knowing
that there is no certainty
and yet working really
hard to what you think.
- It's Isaiah Berlin's
two concepts of freedom.
Anyway for.
- For another class.
- For another class.
- You should hear Reid's discussion.
I guess he's waiting till
the end for the questions.
- We have about 25 minutes.
Then we'll go to questions.
- Also partially,
this is in part a
portrait to how you think
so the people can then go
and ask specific questions
and the things that they know that you
will actually be amazing at.
So board of directors.
How do you compose them?
Is there such a thing
as a high performance
board of directors?
And what would you do
differently with your
years of entrepreneurial
experience doing this?
- When you are interviewing
venture capitalists,
you definitely wanna pick on the people
as opposed to the evaluation.
The quality of the
people in your board room
is super important to you.
I say quality.
It is probably not the right word.
The rapport you have
and the connection you have
and your trust makes a huge difference.
If the people in that very,
that's like a marriage.
It's very hard to get divorced
from your board members.
You gotta spend some time with them
and then say,
"Okay if they're in, they're in."
And then you gotta listen to them,
and then you definitely
have to be honest with them.
You'd be amazed how many CEO's are not
very honest with their board members.
And that's poison because
then the investor has
to constantly be pushing
and probing and trying to
figure out what reality is cause
that's their job.
So you want to really lay
everything on the table
and be the paradigm of honesty
and straightforwardness
with your board members.
And if you've got the right ones,
they won't freak out.
They'll be very thoughtful.
So I would say there's
no perfect board members.
It's unique to each of you of someone
whose judgement you trust.
Whose integrity you trust,
and you enjoy being with.
- Do you think the role of the board
changes as the organization changes size?
And if so how?
- Yeah when you're small
or your board members
know a lot more than you as a company
cause they pattern match on
a lot of different things,
the larger you get,
the more any board member.
I was on the board of Microsoft
for a number of years,
and on Facebook you
spend two days a quarter
on a public board.
And you're just level of depth.
There's not near as strong as the CEO's
and the senior leadership teams.
You're more of a safety net then.
Then you are able to contribute.
- And then the last in terms of the roles,
and then we'll get to the
blitzscaling part of this.
But how should someone
think about knowing whether
or not they're a capable founder or not?
How do you kind of say
"I am. I should actually do this",
versus "I shouldn't do this"?
- It's a good question
and I'm not sure I didn't know.
I just cared about the product
of this first product idea I had.
I wanted to see that out.
And I was definitely reluctant CEO.
A couple of times I
screwed up badly enough
that I said to the board,
"Let's get someone in who
knows what they're doing
and I'll be VP of engineering
and I'll be fine."
And both times they said,
"No you did screw up,
but we still rather have
you than someone else
and the dislocation that that brings."
So that's why I say I was reluctant.
And the whole first company
which was '91 and '97,
I was kind of miserable.
I was always underwater.
The company was always,
as soon as I learned something,
the company was bigger.
I was killing myself physically
and mentally trying so hard
and just underwater.
Then that got acquired in '97,
and we started Netflix.
That's like 15 people that was like
compared to the other company had 700.
It was like so easy.
So then Netflix has been fantastic
and total joy for me because
it's kind of like your
second kid or something
where your first kid it's a panic.
"Oh my God."
And depending on the kids,
as long as they're both healthy,
your second kid is much easier
and you're much less freaked out.
So for me then I have enjoyed the last
18, 19 years tremendously because
I've been able to keep
up with the challenges.
- So let's shift to
scaling and blitz scaling.
One of the things that you
and I have actually had
a conversation about for
as like sometimes these things
are just normal scale up
and sometimes there's blitz scaling.
Netflix is actually more of an example of
kind of just regular scaling.
There's relatively little
blitz scaling within it.
But it's one of the things where,
actually in fact the consistency,
the expecting growth also matters
and being systematic
about how you change size.
What's your sense of the key
characteristics to know
in advance in order to scale right?
And then what's your
kind of reflections on
the kind of the different levels?
- Well let's see.
There are scale economies in businesses
like Amazon and Netflix.
The bigger you get,
the cheaper the marginal customer sale is.
And those are powerful.
Those merit you investing
forward to get to scale,
and so running losses for
the first couple of years
doing things like that.
So call that normal business.
And then there's a couple
of rare businesses like
LinkedIn and Facebook that
are network effect businesses.
And then the prize of getting big first is
so much larger than just a scale business.
Then in those businesses,
it's worth selling 90% of the company to
raise a $1 billion,
to be the big one.
You must be the winner.
It's such extreme winner-take-all.
I think it's the degree of winner-take-all
and network effect that gets you to either
take the risks
and the stress of blitz
scaling rather than
the more.
Like Netflix, like Amazon,
in the early years we're
going 80% year over year,
and then 70% and 60% an hour 25.
And 25 at our size or
Amazon's are big numbers.
But that's like a normal
great scaling business.
And both Amazon against Walmart
and us against cable and satellite.
We have huge markets.
Growing at these rates is great,
and hopefully we'll be able to grow
for 20 years.
And Amazon the same.
But then there's a couple of businesses.
Again eBay was one of the first
where it's real network effect.
And in those businesses,
I think you do kind of
crazy practices because
you've got to grow 300%
to maximize the opportunity.
So you're gonna be sloppy
on a number of things.
So you probably don't
worry about talent density
and you don't do a bunch
of the things that I
described which are the
things that are appropriate
if you are trying to be a
careful disciplined operator.
But if it's "get big or go home",
and then that's the interesting thing.
But it, again, most
businesses is not that.
It's businesses that have network effect.
- Well some of the things that
I think interesting about it
is sometimes it's network effect.
Sometimes you have to
get to a minimum scale,
which is Amazon and you.
And there's a number of other businesses.
The thing I think is,
would be fun to get some
perspective on here for you
is when do you think that it's necessary
to move fast because of competition?
So like for example,
well another thing I
think drives scaling fast
is you say,
"Okay I've got to occupy the
green field market before them"
cause presumably this is a
little bit of how you think
about global now in terms of,
it's not just a question
of content in globalism,
but it's a question of,
"Look we've proven this thing
and let's, in every relevant
market in the world,
this is something we should be there."
So no?
- No, or yes and no.
A company can get started
two or three years
before us in Germany,
and we can knock them out in 12 months
because we have great scale,
and it's not a network of facts.
Where with eBay tried to
knock out Yahoo! Japan,
they didn't succeed
and that's been permanent.
So if you're in the
network effect business,
then you get more of first is forever.
Cause the barriers are really strong.
But if you're just in the scale business,
you can go in with a lot of content
and energy depending
on what your market is
and that's why Amazon.
It's like how quickly
did they wipe out CDNow
in like 1999?
Like really quickly right?
Because it didn't matter that
CDNow had started earlier,
more scale on that side.
Again I think it's really
related to barriers
and these network effect
barriers are so strong.
- Although just as you're saying,
scale barriers are relevant too.
Cause once you get to a certain size,
you can leverage your
size in order to win.
Cause that's precisely your Germany point.
- There are scale economies.
They're just not as strong as a barrier.
So you can think a barrier
as how much pricing power
do you have,
which could either be how much advertising
or what the literal price is.
And if you've got a ton of pricing power,
then you can raise prices a lot
and it's still very hard
to come after you because
you've got that network.
- Were there any,
as you got larger in
terms of the organization,
were there any new
strategies that you added?
Cause a classic one is
corporate development
in terms of that's something
you now do when you're
hundreds of people versus
earlier or in the thousands.
Were there any kind of
key strategies that got,
obviously original content
was the one that came out
and scaled?
- Yeah not particularly for us.
So in 17 years we have
never done an acquisition.
Obviously we haven't been acquired.
And corporate development is M&amp;A.
Again we haven't had those
kind of dynamics in our market.
There's other markets where
the key thing is to buy up
a bunch of companies
that might be competitors
or adjoining to get to
scale and differentiation.
- So let's do a last few questions
on kind of Silicon Valley
and then open up to the group.
So what do you think makes
Silicon Valley so unique
in the world?
- Well there have been a
lot of companies like Amazon
that are scale businesses,
not network effect
that are successful outside
of Silicon Valley cause
you don't have to be here I
think to do a scale business.
So far all the network effect
businesses are here because
it's this network effect is when you
need to do blitz scaling.
You need to be in Silicon Valley,
or it's like ten times better
as opposed to only 50% better.
- So it's here or China.
- In their markets yes.
Fair enough.
So China's such a self-contained market.
It's an isolated island because
of the great firewall that it just,
it might be a different planet.
It's got its own ecosystem.
- But huge island.
(crowd laughing)
- Okay, it's an island for the
rest of the world that
headquarters has been here.
- And why do you think Silicon Valley
tends to be network effects?
- I think it's historic factors that
get Detroit to be the
center of the car world,
and then there's more talent
there to build car companies.
You get those kind of.
You get Manhattan
and London for financial products.
So you get density.
It's almost irrelevant why it started.
it's just that once it happens,
then it's the best place to be.
And then continues to be a better.
I mean it's a much better place now
than it was 20 years
ago for entrepreneurs.
And then that was better
than 20 years before that.
The more of you that do companies,
the more there's that ecosytem.
And so our benefits as
an area continue to go.
Again but if you've got like a minor idea,
that will be a $10 million
business in ten years,
pretty good really.
Move to Austin.
Do not do that here because
you're competing with blow-away ideas
for people and talent and money
and cost of talent.
- Are there any myths that
you think we tell ourselves
that Silicon Valley people
that are worthy of exploding?
- Not obviously but.
- I'll give you one
that I think is kind of,
actually in fact I think a
lot of Silicon Valley people
think that they're actually
very good at managing
and actually in fact,
they're not bad at managing
but actually in fact it's the
composition of how you put
together like network effects businesses.
How do you do a disruption
in the industry.
Those kind of things
create a lot of things.
It's not actually in fact
genius management techniques.
- Do you think Larry Page
or Steve Jobs would've said
they're good at managing?
I think Larry Page is amazing scientist,
and he's a really deep thinker,
and he's an amazing guy to inspire
and lead Google.
But visionary in so many ways.
But not like you would go into GE
and be that successful.
He doesn't think of himself
as a general manager.
And so I don't think most
Silicon Valley people.
Tim Cook might cause he grew up on that.
In operations and he is
a very talented manager.
So it just goes to show that,
you look at how successful
Tim Cook's been at Apple.
It's been phenomenal
and he's obviously a very
different person than Steve was,
and different management style.
Which just says that there's
multiple styles that work.
I think you shouldn't
try to be someone else.
Don't like read about Steve Jobs
and then start wearing
mock black turtlenecks.
(crowd laughing)
Be yourself.
Oh God here I am in black.
(crowd laughing)
Figure out what your emotional
center is and be that really great.
And don't try to be other people.
I mean it's fine to read about them,
but there's no one style that.
And if you look at the varieties
of the really successful companies,
the variety of leaders is quite wide.
- [Voiceover] Can you talk
a little bit about the
switch from DVD's to streaming
and how you internally
organize the product teams?
Did you buy everyone
and bring the different teams
or did they change their duties?
- So question is how do
we evolve the internal
management to move from DVD to streaming?
Because the first
streaming product offering
was integrated into DVD.
If you were a DVD subscriber for Netflix,
you then got a little
bit of free streaming
and then you got a little
more free streaming.
It was pretty integrated
as opposed to it was a separate offering.
So it only got really
difficult when we got to
a separate offering.
There's a streaming service from Netflix,
and there's a DVD service.
And the only really painful part was
probably 2010 or 2011 when out of 30 VP's
we had five focused on the DVD.
And this was a close knit exec team
and then we kicked the
five out of the meeting.
And we realized we have to eat, sleep
and breathe streaming like Hulu.
And not also have this great five people.
And of course they felt bad,
and eventually they realized
they're great at DVD's
and they should follow that.
So there was a time of separation.
But in the first part it was integrated,
but that's because the product
offering was integrated.
- In the back.
- [Voiceover] I'm curious about how the
regulatory risks has
helped with your strategy
as to play this technicality
and international expansion.
Has this affected the
core of business now or?
- Well as you grow.
- [Reid] Repeat the question.
- Yes thanks the question
is how a regulatory strategy
has been important.
We've had to fight for net neutrality
and a big threat for us
was that cable companies
who are most broadband would get to charge
us a tremendous amount to be
able to serve our customers
as opposed to be pretty open
and that they would have
an advantage cause they
wouldn't charge themselves.
So we've had to fight that
regulatory battle over
the last four years.
And then every company that gets large
faces anti-trust concerns over time.
You see that with Google
in Europe right now.
- [Voiceover] Why don't you police
users sharing their
account with other users?
That must be something really
deep that concerns you guys.
- So question is why don't we
police or crack down on users
who share with other users?
So when a wife shares with
her husband the password,
it's probably okay.
When the dad shares with the kids
that are six years old living at home,
it's probably okay.
When that kid goes to college,
it's probably okay.
Remember 90% of kids live at home
when they go to college.
So that's definitely okay.
So now the kids hanging out
in the apartment next door
then maybe that's okay.
Or is it not?
Or when the kid arrives at college,
is that okay?
So the only thing that's really not okay
is the dorm room.
So the dorm gets an account.
The fraternity gets an account.
And 30 people do it.
And there's an easy check
on that which is you only
get one or two concurrent
streams at the same time.
You're not gonna share too broadly.
And to get more concurrent streams,
it's more cost.
And so that is an effective
limiter on broadscale sharing
and then we don't have
to try to police people's
living situations.
It is three friends?
Three friends in an apartment,
is that legitimate or not?
We get to skid out of all of that.
- [Voiceover] So I read on Netflix.
On the website it talks
about sports mentality
when it comes to managing.
I'm just curious what's the benefit
and some like setting my account back?
- Sure the classic,
it's probably not for you guys
but it used to be a classic
metaphor for companies
was the family.
And you'd hire them
and you'd be like,
"We're a family.
We look after each other."
And it's kind of baloney because
you'll lay someone off in a way that you
wouldn't your sister.
You want them to work for you
like they were a family member
for free and cheap,
but you're not really
prepared to treat them
like a family member if you're honest.
Really the professional
relationship is like a sports team.
And if you want to win a championship,
you got to have incredible
talent at every position.
We said,
"Look we're like a professional sport",
not like your kid's soccer team,
but a "professional sports team where
we pay people well.
We want them to win."
And if you have one bad game,
you don't lose your position.
But ultimately you're fighting
for your position every year.
And that's how we feel about it.
As long as we're honest about it,
it's exciting cause then you can play
really sophisticated sports.
So to do a blind pass in soccer
and you just know the person's there,
that's an art.
You need great teammates.
That you are so well rehearsed.
To do that you need great talent
and that's fun to be around.
- So we'll get to Chris's
question in a second,
but that's too good of a layup.
Comments on Chris and
my's book "The Alliance".
- Meaning in short terms of duty?
You're signing up to get something done,
which is like a player's contract.
We don't tend to use
contracts in Silicon Valley,
but Hollywood does.
Their practice is formalized.
You sign up for three years or five years
and they mostly stick.
And so the next evolution
of the alliance is
introducing contracts
in the Silicon Valley.
Again we're not used to it
from a labor standpoint,
but large sectors of the
economy work that way,
and it works fine.
It's a different system.
- So the first part is,
can you talk about a
few of the other things
that you decided to do
differently as Pure Software?
And then the second part is
you've talked about investing
yourself like what are the
things that have been most
productive in terms of
return on investment
and investment itself?
- Sure.
The big thing that we
do differently as Pure
we were really trying,
which was '91 and '97 to be efficient.
We were engineers running a company,
and so every time something went wrong,
we put a process in
place to make sure that
didn't go wrong again.
Which is a very semiconductor
yield frame of reference.
We saw everything as a
magic set of processes.
But then the market shifted on us
and in that case from C++ to Java,
and it turned out that
everyone that the company
had were well adapted
to following the rules
and implementing the processes.
But that doesn't make them the
people who are well adapted
to re-think the market
and how should we approach
this other market.
The company struggled mightily
and ultimately was sold because of that.
What we realized is we were over-optimized
for one business,
and we had led the company become,
it's like monoculture agriculture,
we had one strain of
wheat over a huge area.
Very efficient in the short term.
And then what we should have
optimized for is flexibility.
And that in fact all
companies face challenges
when market shifts so we
should have been more tolerant
of inefficiency and mistake and error,
and more focused on flexibility because
I think in the long term,
flexibility is what's chosen for.
So if you think of human evolution,
we're not very well adapted
to many specific things
and we humans are super
well adapted to be flexible.
And so our lifeform has
conquered the world because
of that flexibility
despite many maladaptations
for any particular climate.
Of course there's many
examples if you think about it.
And the trick is management
is generally short term.
You're focused on making
these better next year,
and that's mostly efficiency seeking.
So you have to balance
that with some long term
about the value of seeking flexibility.
- [Reid] And then the second part was?
- Best thing for,
it probably varies by person.
For me it's been reading
combination of western civ
and leadership and management books.
"Beyond entrepreneurship"
is one of my favorite,
Jim Collins before he did "Good to Great"
and "Built to Last."
This book in '95 or '96 he published it.
And the first 80 pages you can read that
every year for ten years.
It's really perfect for the entrepreneur,
"Beyond Entrepreneurship."
- [Voiceover] Can you talk
more specifically about how
you incorporated the machine learning
and the AI side of
things with your own data
set up Netflix,
and the wild crazy world
of Hollywood in producing?
How do you evaluate
content that's passed on,
especially now since you're
gonna have a lot of pitches?
- It is, we basically,
it's a good insight.
The question is how do
you apply machine learning
to picking content or developing content?
We basically don't.
Your intuition as how
would that be relevant.
What shows up when you
open Netflix on your iPhone
or on the web or on the TV
that is a ranking problem.
The ecosystem is pretty
good at ranking problems.
So it's a big ranking problem.
What are the titles most relevant
and interesting to you?
So it's really big on that aspect.
Now we can apply that on marketing also
with real-time bidding
and personalized marketing.
But in terms of picking shows,
that's like picking employees.
It's a human judgement task
of what's gonna be big.
Once a show's produced,
we can selectively promote
it on statistical techniques
based on who's enjoying it,
who's watching it really quickly versus
watching it slowly.
What other people are like that?
So promoting the content to the
right subset of the audience
which is critical when you've
got a big global audience,
is a very machine learning problem.
But the actual production,
like other people have tried
to do script analysis systems.
When you take a script
and you code it up in all these dimensions
and then try to do predictions.
And none of it's worked.
So there's so much in
the artistic execution
that you as a consumer
then love from the script.
And once it's produced,
there's no value in predicting it.
You're just gonna put it out and try.
- [Voiceover] So as a quick bog,
so is the focus of Netflix gonna be
one show for larger audiences
or smaller shows for niche audiences?
- The question is are
we focused on big shows
or small shows,
and we're agnostic.
We're focused on intensity.
We want you to love what you watch,
and sometimes that will
be a big show cause
you're in the mainstream of
the society that you live in
and sometimes it will
be a neat show because
you're not at the mainsteam.
But again it's all about intensity.
We have to match cost of production
to the expected size of the audience,
but we're just as happy to
do small shows as big shows
especially as you get to
personalized marketing externally
and of course you've got
personalized merchandising
within the service.
- [Voiceover] So it seems
as though you guys get a lot
more creative direction to the people that
you obviously contract to make it famous.
I was just wondering how
you balance that with
making sure that you ensure
these are good shows?
- So the question is how do
we ensure these are good shows
and how much creative direction do we do.
It depends upon the show.
Generally we like to meet with a team
and then if we like them and back them,
let them run.
We're very hands off once we've made
a decision to back them.
If they want in pub,
we give it to them.
We'll do these things.
But relative to other studios,
we're much more letting them run,
and we've won a reputation for that
in the creative community.
- So last question from
that side in the jacket.
- [Voiceover] So especially
when you're first starting out,
how quickly should you go to your board
and your board of advisors,
and how do you think about
the limited characteristics?
- You know it's a much
better ecosystem for that,
especially the board of advisors level now
than it was 20 years ago.
I ended up not having
any board of advisors
and it wasn't that common.
I think Reid Hoffman
would be a much better
much more insightful for you on that.
Sort of the subtlety of the
current startup ecosystem
or Sam Altman that you've met
and just not that qualified for it.
- So with that let's
thank Reed for joining us
for a lovely time.
(audience claps)
