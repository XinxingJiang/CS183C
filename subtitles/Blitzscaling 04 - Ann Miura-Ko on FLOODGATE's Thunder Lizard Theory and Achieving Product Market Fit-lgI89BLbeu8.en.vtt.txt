WEBVTTKind: captionsLanguage: en- Alright, so this will be last,this'll be the fourth session we haveon the earliest stage of starting up,this organizational skill one.
And so today, we have Ann Miura-Ko.
We're very lucky to have her.
Ann is a co-founder ofa firm called Floodgate,which is one of the most interesting,I think one of the mostinteresting funds around,and they invest in awide variety of stuff.
We'll talk about physical goods,we'll talk about marketplace,we'll talk about biology,we'll talk about math.
Ann is probably the mosteducated person in the room,at least, by a long stretch,and she'll tell us about it.
I'm just gonna let her jump in,and she's gonna talk about whatat Floodgate they see that's interesting,and how they think about whatthey see early stage thatthey think translates intoimportant, durable companies.
So we'll just let Ann talk,and then we'll do someQ and A like we didwith Michael on Tuesday.
- So, yeah, my talk is calledHunting Thunderlizards,and Thundarlizards is actually a termthat my cofounding partnerhas talked a lot about.
His name is Mike Maples.
We've been working togetherfor a number of years,since 2008.
So just to dive in andgive you a little bitbackground about me.
Palo Alto native, so I've grew up here.
Went to Paly High, went to,snuck into some Stanford partiesas a high school senior.
Went to Yale, Electrical Engineering.
Went to McKinsey, andthen got into investingkind of by chance.
Partner at Charles RiverVentures by the name ofTed Dintersmith gave me a shot,and we actually had thisincredible conversationabout books and music that we loved,and at the end of it, hebasically offered me a job.
I ended up starting workingfor him a day before 9/11.
So my second day of workwas 9/11, and I got to seewhat happens in venture investingwhen everything comesto a screeching halt.
I eventually ended up at Stanford Ph.D.
I got my Ph.D. in theOperations Research Groupdoing math modeling of computer security.
Had the opportunity to interact a lotwith Stanford students, andreally fell in love withthe act of teaching.
In fact, I'm gonna givea plug for my class.
In the Spring quarter,I'm gonna be teachingMSNE275, and this is sort of a test runfor some of the elements of the coursethat I'm gonna be teaching.
And then I ended up at Floodgate.
Floodgate, we started in 2008.
I was thinking of startingmy own company at the timeand I was told by one of my mentorsI should go and find an angel investorwho has a lot of experience lookingat very early stage things and seewhat's going on in the real world.
I started doing thatwith Mike once a week.
We'd look at companies together.
In the midst of that, heturned to me and said,"I think I've accidentally raised a fund.
"And I think in thatcase, you should join me.
"This isn't a venture back startup"like you're thinking of doing,"but it's a backed venturestartup, so let's go."And so in 2008, I got started.
These are some of the companiesI've been involved with.
I had a really greatstring of beginner's luck,so in 2008, as you can imagine,was a really hard year economically.
But turns out, it wasa great year to becomea venture investor,because not many peoplewere actually writing checks,and so between 2009 and 10,I actually invested in three companies.
My first was TaskRabbit.
My second one wasModcloth, and the third onewas Zimride, which turned into Lyft.
And all three of those companies,I really kinda wax nostalgic about them,because it was a period where I really hadno background in investing.
I had nothing to turn to tosay this is my track record.
And so each one of those founders,whether it was LeahBusque or John Zimmermanand Logan Green or Eric and Susan Koger.
They, as much as I took a bet on them,they took a bet on me.
And so since then, I'veinvested in Refinery29,which has really taken off.
Ayasdi actually was bornin this very buildingin the Math Department, andso I'll talk a little bit moreabout why I think companieslike that are significant.
And so what are thunderlizards?This is sort of a centraltheme for Floodgate.
We talk a lot about these animals.
They are obviouslyinspired, not by dinosaurs,but they are inspired by Godzilla.
And they represent what we think ofwhen we think of entrepreneurs,the tremendous scaledentrepreneurs that have gonethrough blitzscaling.
They are born from what wecall radioactive atomic eggs.
And so there is something,there's a genetic mutationfrom the day zero withthese entrepreneurs.
They then swim across the Pacific Oceanand have this incrediblelong journey through lotsof dangerous things.
They stop off in Hawaiioften, and then end up in,depending on whether Mike tells the story,he says that they end up in Tokyo.
I like the version where itends up in San Francisco.
And he emerges in San Francisco Baywith an attitude, andstarts to wreak havoc.
And we like the olderversions of this as well.
They shoot laser beamsout of their mouths.
The best ones eat trains.
Some of them will eat ships.
But what does that mean?Why does that imagery evokeentrepreneurship for me,for Mike, for people we talkabout thunderlizards to.
Well, we think about it insort of four different areas.
One is, and probably thisis the most powerful notion,is that they've somehowconverted their advantageto truly disruptive power.
And when I say disruptivepower, that to meevokes a lot of what we see in Godzilla.
You don't see this inGodzilla, but these companieswill minimize technicaland organizational risk,or organizational debt.
These are the thingsthat happen in a companyas you're acting quickly, whereyou are accruing some cost.
And great companieswill minimize that debt.
You will achieve product market fit.
So all of these companies will havean incredible feel for the product,but will also have a pull fortheir product from the market.
It's almost uncontrolledpull of their product.
And then lastly, this issomething that Peter Thielhas also talked about,they avoid competition.
And so these are the fourthings that we believeresult from the fact thatyou are a thunderlizard.
The thunderlizards are really rare.
And this is actuallya slide from McKinsey.
And I thought this was really fascinatingbecause if you took allof the IPOs that happenedbetween 1980 and 2012,there's about 3,000 of them.
But the number thatwas most striking to mewas how many of these havemore than $4,000,000,000 in revenues.
Well, it turns out it's only 17 companies.
And if you can imagine whatit takes to get to be one ofthose 17, those are thetruly legendary businesses.
And even getting to an IPOis already exceedingly rare.
There are roughly only about25 companies in any given yearthat exit at greater than $500,000,000.
And so if you think aboutthat, that is the actualwhen you have your exit event,there's only about 25 ofthose in any given year,and it really doesn'tmatter what year it is.
You might have a slightblip one year, but this yearlooks like it's gonna beright around 20 to 25 again.
And so when we think abouthow do you describe what that looks like?So we know that they're exceedingly rare,but Floodgate, we investeither really earlyor way too early, so weare the first institutionalfinancing that happensfor a startup company.
We're cutting checks between$500,000 and $3,000,000into a company.
And so that means that we need to spot itway earlier than most otherlarger venture capital firms.
And so Mike and I spent alot of time thinking aboutnot only what do we try to spot,but also as we work with these companies,what's the groundworkthat needs to be laidso that when they go on totheir next round of financingor future rounds offinancing, they don't accruethe kind of debt that could reallyhamper the company's growth.
And so we think about it in terms ofwhat I call the Value Stack.
And this is really sausage being made.
I describe this as sort ofstuff that I'm still working on.
This is the first time actuallyteaching this in a course format.
I've whiteboarded it previously,so if any of you have questions on this,I'd love to get feedback as we go along.
If I start at the bottom, Icall it proprietary power.
I used to call it technology.
And so this is the placewhere you get somethingvery unique, it's an insight that you havethat then allows you to avoid competition.
You go to the next layer,and it's product power.
That's where you achieve thismagical product market fit.
And then you get to a point whereyou have that product market fit,but now you need to make sure thatyou have a real sustainable company.
And then ultimately from that company,you don't wanna just have agreat sustainable company,you want to have one that dominates,and that's what we call category kings.
And so if you can translatethe initial energythat you have withinyour company as a startupinto all of thesedifferent levels of powerthen we believe you have the capacityto become one of these thunderlizards,and we're looking for early signs of that.
I'm gonna go into each ofthese little levels of power.
So within the bottom ofthe value stack, yeah.
- [Student] When youlook at a new company,is there something that ratesthem on those four metrics,or are those the foundation by which you,lenses by which you look at a company?- Yeah, so I'll repeat the question.
Do I actually have sort of a scorecard,essentially is thequestion, along the linesof all of these different dimensions.
We don't actually have a scorecard,but these are different levelsthat we will talk through.
And we will pretty explicitly talk aboutwhat the company has, andwhat the company doesn't have.
And oftentimes whenturning down a company,it's because there's something in therethat we feel there's lackingon one of these dimensions.
So if we start with proprietary power,this is probably the partthat I spend the most time,because this is probably the most evidentat the early stages of a company.
And this is, it couldbe a technical insight.
So oftentimes, it's gonnaturn up as proprietary IP.
So Ayasdi's story is that it started outwith Gunnar Carlsson, who was the Chairmanof the Math Department here at Stanford.
He had 25 years of research in topologicaldata analysis, and his graduate studentactually turned it into real product.
And from there, theypublished four papers.
I encoungered Gurjeet at that time,and then he turned it into a business planand ultimately, wefunded it at that moment.
But it was 25 years of research,so when you look atAyasdi, one of the thingsthat's interesting aboutit is they have technologythat is in many ways unassailable.
Another way to look at it isdo you have access to scarce supply.
I provide DeBeers as a canonical exampleof you have access to diamonds,then you're probablyin a pretty good spot.
And so scarce supply canactually be a great advantage.
The creation of high switching costs,that's Keurig, right.
So if I buy a Keurigmachine, then I'm probablygonna keep buying thoselittle Keurig cups,because I already boughtthe Keurig machineand I want my coffee.
So that's a really goodlocking in mechnanism.
Network effects, wellyou're being taught byReid Hoffman, who is probablythe king of network effects,so I won't say much about that,but obviously that alsocreates incredible powerand a lock-in for boththe consumer, but thenfrom the network, thenyou drive even more power,and then more people come.
The authentic team, when I thought aboutauthentic team, the immediate story thatcame to mind for me was Lyft.
And the reason why waswhen Zimride first cameto pitch for me, theyhad this incredible storyof how the two founders met.
And so I was looking through the notesfrom the last lecture,where Michael Dearingwas talking about transportation,and I love that part of his lecture,because it was actually very reminiscentof the pitch that John and Logan gave me.
When John talked aboutwhy he joined Zimride,so Logan was first to get it started,and he had this interesting story of howhe had joined the Transportation Boardof Santa Barbara, because he was convincedthere was gonna be something there,and then we turned to John and said,"Well how did you get interested?"He told us an incredible story of howwhen he was at Cornell,he had this professorwho did essentially Michael Dearing's talkabout transportation, andthere was this one slidethat he put up where he said,"Look, whenever there's been a huge"discontinuous shift in the economy,"it's always been lead by something"that's changed in transportation."He talked about the canals,he talked about trains,then he talked about the highway system.
And John said, "I know thatthere's something next,"and I want to be part of that,"And that's what Zimride's about.
And what's interesting to me is Zimridethen switched into Lyft.
That story, I've shown that pitch,the pitch for Zimride to other people,and you wouldn't actually know untilyou got to the product descriptionthat the pitch was not for Lyft.
And so we really look at theauthenticity of the team.
So when I invested in Zimride in 2010,it took two years for themto get to the product pivot,which got them to Lyft.
And so that was two yearsof quite a bit of work,quite a bit of heartacheto get to that point,and you can imagine whatkind of impact that has,and so we have a strong viewpoint thatall of this, proprietary power, canbe unlocked pretty quickly inthe early stages of startup,and something that's probablyeasiest for us to assess.
Any questions on that?Yep.
- [Student] In today'sworld, where you think abouthow the barriers to entryhave lowered significantly,'cause technically peoplebeing able to work on projects,how has that made youchange the way you thinkor place certain emphasison different aspects of this project?- So all the building product is easier.
Actually, developingthese insights is not.
And so I think that'swhat's important to meis there's something that youknow that no one else knows.
One of the things that was told to meas I was doing researchfor developing this stackwas the founder of VivaSystems, whose company IPOeda couple years ago, they hadonly raised $7,000,000 total,and I think four of it was touched.
But he said, "Every greatstartup has one fundamental"assumption that hasa less than 50% chance"of being correct,"but if true, will give you a"20x, 100x advantage in market."And I love that kind of notionof what is non-consensus, but rightfor these magical startups?For Viva Systems, it was actually buidlingtheir entire platform on top of force.com.
Lot of people thoughtthat was just a crazy,kind of stupid idea.
Why would you build, howwould you possibly builda billion dollar companyon top of sales force?He proved that he could.
So regardless of how easyit is to build a companyor build a product, we think that havingsome sort of insightthat says, "Well I have"access to very scarce supply," or"I have proprietary IP,"or "I know something about"the market shift that's happening"that no one else does."That's what enables youto unlock the market powerbefore anyone else does.
Any other questions?Alright.
Then we go to product power.
And what's interesting is with product,it's being able to achievethat product market fit.
But before you get here, so if you haveproprietary IP, there'sa good chance that younever actually get to product power,and we see examples of thatprobably all over Stanford,which is you find this reallyinteresting piece of researchand you're trying to figure outhow to turn it into a startup company,and then someone atsome point says to you,"That's technology insearch of a problem."And so you might haveincredible proprietary power,but it can be very difficultto turn into product power.
Product power is when youachieve product market fit.
And it's, and a lot of peoplethrow out product market fitas if, it's a product thathits any kind of market,someone in the world likes it, then youhave product market fit.
That's not product market fit.
Product market fit implies market power.
It's the market that needsto be large and growing.
Oftentimes when youhit product market fit,it feels uncontrolled.
In fact, with Instagram,there's a great example of that.
Mike talks about, at the very first weekwhen they launched Instagram,they had this momentwhere they realized that,and they knew, they had the sense thaton the weekends, the trafficwould suddenly increase,and he knew, it was ona Monday or Tuesday,that if they didn't getthe Instagram serviceoff of servers and into the cloud,that they were completelyscrewed for the weekend.
And so they worked day andnight to get that to happen,and they were finally able to get itto be a scaleable service by Friday.
And he knew that at thatpoint, he said within 12 hoursof having launchedInstagram, they actuallyhad a really good sense that Kevin Systromhad a very good sense thatthis was gonna be a huge hitand I think Mike was a littlebit more skeptical for a whilebut he always felt like it was a trainwhose wheels were coming off.
And so the question Ioften get from founders isdo I have product market fit?And the answer to that question isif you're asking, you don't.
And then, a lot of people will also askisn't it true that you canactually create a marketif you have a transformative product?And that's true, too,but it rarely happens.
I think the example that Icould come up with was VMware.
VMware was so transformativethat it createdan entire market, where therereally wasn't one previously.
Any questions, there? Yeah.
- [Student] Are theremaybe smaller metricsthat maybe you would seeclues in the beginning?'Cause for example, Airbnb.
I know that they didn't really get thatskyrocket thing at the very start.
They worked for probably a couple yearsbefore they really caughtthat product market fit.
So are there smaller cluesthat you could see beforehand?- I feel like that wasactually, even with Airbnb,there was this momentwhere, I think it wasthe Democratic NationalConvention, where Obamafirst presented.
That was a real moment for them.
There is actually a moment where you startto see that grow.
I think the place where itcan be harder is marketplaces.
And marketplaces can actually takea really, really, really long time,because it's this very difficult balanceof the supply and the demand.
And oftentimes, you'll see companieskind of getting that balance wrongin the early days, andit takes a little whilefor them to really mesh.
But I think of this asreally a binary concept.
And there can be early signs.
It really depends on what you are,what kind of company you are,what those metrics are.
Any other questions?Yeah.
- [Student] Do you know of any good waysto test the market beforegoing into it full force?- Yeah, so customer discovery.
I've taught a lot with Steve Wang.
There's the whole sort of processand four steps to epiphanyand what Eric Ries talks about.
I think there's goodways of just going outto customers and testingout your hypotheses.
Oftetimes, actually,I've seen entrepreneurstrack all of their hypotheses, even inan Excel spreadsheet, and start to say,"This is my hypothesis.
"This is how I'm gonna test it,"and this is what I expect to see."And it's very much a scientific method.
I think the thing where that can go wrongis that it's as much anart as it is a science.
You have to know when yourexperiments were wrongso that the experimentitself could be flawed.
It could also be that theway in which it was presentedwasn't quite right.
And so you have to befairly honest with yourselfabout what went wrong in those tests,but I do think thatthere are ways in whichyou can actually access the customer,get in front of them and seeif there's an aha moment.
Again, with Instagram, it was interesting.
They said when they were with Burbn,they noticed actually thatyou could post pictures,but it was like a five step process.
You had to go intosettings, you had to findthis bespoke email address, and then youwould have to email your pictures to thisbespoke email address,and then it would besomehow posted into Burbn, but peoplewere actually doing that.
And they noticed within that streamthat that was somethingthey were interested inand that's why they doubled down on it.
And so oftentimes, it'snot what you want to seeand what you're lookingfor, but the thingsthat are sort of outside of realmthat help you notice, "Oh that's a problem"that I might wanna solve."And so oftentimes when we say,when you go into do customer discovery,you don't want to say,"Take a look at my product"and tell me what you think."You want to ask them about,"What's your life like?"What are some of theproblems that you face?"And it's in those conversationsthat you might actually find inspirationfor the real productthat you want to build.
Anything else?Okay.
And then from there,we go to company power.
This is actually where, whenyou're scaling your company,you're talking about discoveringa scaleable business model.
You're trying to figureout what the culturalvalues are for your company, and what youridentity is as a company.
It's how you develop yourown company narrative,the personality of the place.
It's how you developtalent, reward talent,provide career paths for individuals,and it's how you foster communicationwithin that culture.
And companies that I think have done thisreally, really well, Facebook.
But also Netflix is really well known forsome of their HR documentation.
But it goes way more than,far beyond what I would say is just HR,and I would emphasize, do you have thatscaleable business model,does it make sense today?I would argue that there'slots of unicorns todaythat are still searching forthat scaleable business model.
And that means that there's a lot of debtthat can actually be incurred.
If you don't have theright processes in place,you will actually incura lot of technical debt.
You will also incur a lot ofcompany organizational debt.
I see this in my own companies,where you have eight C-level executivesand you're thinking to yourself,"How do we get here?"Well, it's just organizational debt.
And then the compensationschemes are really messed up.
That's organizational debt.
People feel like theydon't have a career path.
That's organizational debt.
And then so these are also, in some ways,when you look at the founderand you talk to them,you can also start to spotare these people who arethinking about thesethings, who will be opento thinking about thesethings, who want tothink about these things,and how open are theyto that kind of conversation?And those are things thatwe actually do look forin the early stages aswell, because again,if we believe that the founder is gonna bethe CEO for the longterm, these are thingsthat they're gonna have to grow into.
And we want to at leastbe aware of whether or notthey care about these things.
Yeah.
- [Student] Can you talkmore about the signsin the early stage thatyou look for in founders,'cause often this when you're scaling,and you're looking at embryos.
So is there anything you sort of seeas patterns from people whocare about this later on?- Yeah, I think one of thethings is actually early hiring.
So how good are they at hiring,and what are they willing to give upto get the best people?We have one company, actually,that has been able to attractreally ridiculous talentfrom big companies,Facebook, Square, Twitter,and you talk to them abouthow he was able to to that.
He spends a lot of time thinking aboutnot only who he's hiring andwhat kind of networks they'llbring to the table, but alsohow they do interviewing.
What do they put togetherfor a compensation plan?They think about it in areally rigorous manner,almost just as much as theythink about the product.
And to me, that's, those are early signs.
When I invested inAyasdi, part of the thingthat convinced me was thatGurjeet brought on boardthis incredible product person,and he was very open about the fact thatthere were things that he did not know,and that he wanted toknow, but he also wanted tosurround himself with peoplewho would support him in that.
And so all of these typesof signals are around.
What is the type ofcompany you want to build?What's your fundamental values?A lot of the founders that are successfulare fairly generous with equity.
They want people to feel like an ownerand not just an employee.
So those are the types ofthings that we're looking for.
It's more philosophyrather than explicit thingsthat you'll actually see as signs.
It's not metrics driven.
And then lastly, category power.
From my friends at Play Bigger,which is a great organization,two guys who are CMOs of companies.
But they talk about how do you derivecategory kings.
And to me, what is it?These are the guys that convertall of these advantages that they haveand then create thisincredible disruptive power.
And in a lot of senses, they will actuallydefine a whole new category, because theydon't want to compete.
They want to be the bigGodzilla on the block.
And so I think a great exampleof that is Netflix, actually.
When they came in, they weren't saying,"I'm gonna compete with Blockbuster."They didn't compete, theycreated a whole new categoryand then destroyed Blockbuster.
They destroyed the category and rebuilt itin a way that suited them.
And I think Starbucksis another great examplethat who would've thunk that peoplewould want to drink $3 coffee, a $5 coffeewhen you could get it for $.50.
They completely redefinedthe buying behaviorand enabled a new category to emerge.
Amazon's done the same thing,Apple's done the same thing.
And when we look at companies,one of the things that wethink is really powerfulis how does the founder think aboutthe language that defines thearea that they're going intoand how do they position theircompany within that market?If they feel like they'renot in control of that marketand they're allowing themarket to define who they are,that's something thatworries us a little bit more.
We would prefer to see companiesbe more proactive about it.
And so those are the four elementsof the value stack that we look at.
And obviously, this isactually probably the hardestto view at the stage that we invest in,but in a lot of ways, it canactually be the most important.
If you can become a category king,that's how you capture value the most.
Yep.
- [Student] Can the category powerever come before the company power,or is that a bad sign if that happens?- No, I think it can.
You can start defining a lot of that.
It's separate in some ways.
Category power in a lotof ways is external,whereas company power is internal.
It's how you lookinternally at your business.
It's how you build thatsustainable business model.
Some people will try toget to category powerby buying their way in,so there are companiesthat will spend a ton ofmoney on customer acquisitionand just buy a ton of customers,and try to claim category power,when in reality, it makes no sensefrom a unit economic standpoint.
And so my argument is, at that stage,those are both very important.
You need to actually make sure you havea good, sustainable business model.
And there must be anotherway that you can actuallyget to category power.
- So the question we like to ask everyone,and part of this is becauseReid is so good at it,is what can you safely ignore?So the pitch, one way tointerpret the pitch is,well you should be goodat a lot of things,including building a big companyand a big category with no technical debtand no organizational debt.
And so at the stage of sort of zero,or 1% to 15, what can you ignore?And then I'll ask how muchcan you really ignore it?- Yeah, I think it'smore what do you focus onfirst and foremost?How do you prioritize?For me, the priority is atthe bottom of that stack.
What is that unique advantagethat you're building today,that proprietary power?So if it's IP that youhave, how strong is that?How do you build thatinto an increasing mote?If you have a supply chain advantage,how do you really makethat into a product?I think the second piece you can't ignoreis the product, product market fit.
How do you get there?Those are probably the two thingsthat I focus on, alongside the team.
How do you develop the team internally?Zero to 10, you don'treally need to think aboutcareer path at that point.
You don't need to thinkabout titles so much.
So the organizational debt probably comesa little bit later.
You could actually startto incur technical debt,but a lot of times, you don't even know,it's more important to be awareof what the technical debt is,rather than seeking toreally fix everythingbefore you move on.
'Cause you don't, atthe stage that we're at,you half the time don't know what's gonnastay and what's gonna go, right?And so I would say theone thing that I would sayis the most important for us is the speedat which you're making these decisions.
When a founder is frozenor just needs more data,that's the first signof distress that we see.
- Yeah, and that was athing that came up with Samand Michael both, is speed ofdecision making is critical.
I think any good technologistI've ever talked toknows they have a technical debtas soon as they writethe first line of code,'cause maybe you pickedthe wrong language,the wrong system, or you have the wronginfrastructure or whatever.
So can we talk about thisidea of authentic foundersfor a minute?And so you told a storyabout John and Loganand their story is incredible.
They stood in the same, with me,I remember sitting in their officeand talking about the clever of rides.
So for you, does everyonehave to have an origin story,or how do you tell if they're,not everybody has a storythat's quite as good as theirs.
And so how do you tell whether they shouldbe in it, whether they're authentic?How does that work for you?- Well I really likeseeing some sort of tie.
It doesn't need to beten years in the making.
But I do like to see a tiebetween the idea, and why you?Why is it that you havethat unique insightthat no one else has?And I feel like for almostevery single investmentthat we've made, there is some sort of tiebetween that individual andwhy they're doing that startup.
But authenticity can comein a lot of different forms.
It could be that you areactually the customerand so you have an unusualempathy for the customerbecause you happen to be theperson you're building it for.
And then the proof pointis, how big is that market?But the other could be,I just see something.
I've worked in thisindustry for some time,and there's one team memberwho really understandsthat market.
And I always ask that questionin every single pitch, and so I know thatthat's a important pieceof what we invest in.
- [Professor] The questionyou ask is, "Why you?"- Yeah, why you?And the reason why it's important isyou know this, there's a moment in timewith every single startup,and it may be eventwo or three, where you march throughthe Valley of Death, and in that moment,if this was one of the ten startupsyou had whiteboarded onthe board in your office,and you knew of nineother pretty good ideas,but this was just theone that caught your eyein that moment, you are more likelyto flee the scene in that first stepthrough the Valley of Death,and so we would rather haveentrepreneurs who,it wasn't the tenth ideathat they came about.
But this was the one andit's pretty much the only onethat they want to do.
- Yeah.
I think we go out of our way to say thisover and over and over, Sam Altman did itthe first class of CS23B,and just say, look,starting up is kind of a crappy job.
You can't, there's no room for anythingelse in your life hardly.
And so you only really should do itif you can't not do it.
So that's what I look for, people who aregonna do it irrespective of funders,irrespective of anyone.
It just can't stay in.
That's what Michael Dearing says,is that it kind of has to come out.
- Yeah, it's like literally, you see itsort of physicallyleaping out of their body.
And so it was interestinghow you pitched your stack.
And you call it a stack.
And you talked abouttechnology and a product,because I think that a lot of people noware not doing the technology step.
They start with product,and I would actuallykinda argue that Kevinand Mikey did that, too,which was they figured outproduct first, on Instagramand then they figuredout how to deliver it.
You've got some companiesthat are more like that,and some that are less like that.
So how do you think abouttechnology led startupsversus product letstartups, and is it really,do you really need both?- No.
I don't think so, butthe proprietary level,we like to see some sort of insight there.
- [Professor] Oh, so it'snot technology necessarily?- No, it's like, I would sayit's some sort of proprietaryinsight, whether it's supplychain, or network effects,or it could be some fixedcost that you're able to get,capitalize in some way.
I think there's lots ofdifferent things that cancan kinda lock you in,that's the customer,in a proprietary way.
I think that piece is important.
I would agree, mostthings are not necessarilytechnology led.
When we originally drew out the stack,I had technology at thebottom, and then product.
One of the things I would say was,some people just come inat the product power level,and you can ignore the technology stack,and in fact, most of theaccelerator companies,those are ones that are comingin at that product level.
And so all you're focused onis getting product market fitat that stage.
- And then I guess the question iswhen you're looking attechnologies in IP as a driver...
So you know, Gurjeet was oneof the first guys I met withwhen I started VNVC.
This guy is unbelievable.
He'll talk about, thetechnology roughly istopologies, or topography?- Yeah, toplogy.
- Topology, about how you basically makeN dimensional pictures andspaces of what's happeningin your big data sets, and I was left withthe observation that, man,this guy's unbelievablysmart, and he's built thisincredibly amazing thing,and I couldn't figure outwhat the hell you do with it.
And whether it would matter topeople on the product level.
So how do you get comfort thatthis amazing technologywill bridge to somethingthat is actually useful in the world?- Yeah, and I think the tricky piece,and this is, I invest in a sector,one part of my investments iswhat I call radical scienceinvesting, and that'sPh.D.s and some crazypiece of technology theyhave, and the massive riskthat we take when wemake those investmentsis that it's a technologyin search of a problem.
And I think the reason why Ayasdiactually resonated for me was in my Ph.D.,I actually had extraordinarilycomplex data sets.
They weren't big data inthe traditional sense.
The files weren't thatbig, but it was complex,and so it was hard tosee the actual importantparts of that data set.
And so I had some empathy for whybeing able to take very complex data setsand figure out what was insideof it would be important.
I think, so that actuallycame more from a feeling.
It was more of a gut instinct ofI think there's lotsof data sets out therewhere you have this problem ofit's just a big, hairy thing, and I stilldon't know how to query it.
We also, at that same time period,we were creating, froman investment standpoint,a thesis on big data,and one of the things that I had decidedpretty early on was whendata becomes that largeor that complex, I wasless interested in whereyou were gonna store it orhow you were gonna access it.
I thought the big problem would bewhat do you do with it?And I had gone out and spoken tofinancial institutions,some pharma companiesto see what they were doing.
And so from that perspective, I hadsome insight of, okay, these arethe types of data setsthey're going to have,and probably, you might be able touse that in that setting.
And so in some ways, that waslead by an investment thesis.
We were looking for analytical companies.
There's another company in our portfoliowhich is a company called Inscopix.
It is literally a microscope you canput on the brain of amouse, and you can seethe way it's thinking.
And it was a Ph.D. studentin electrical engineering.
And for probably fiveyears or four years now,we were sort of searching forwhat's the right business model?And it was one of thesethings we don't really knowhow you turn it into this huge business.
- [Professor] Direct to the mouse.
- Yeah.
- [Professor Direct channel to the mice?- Yeah, you literally plugit into your USB port.
Yeah, you could sell the mouse, like"This is what you're thinking."But what was really interesting wasthe guy was really capital efficient.
So he took 1.5 million dollars from meand he never touched it,and he sold something like18.5 million dollars'worth of this device.
And he kept on iterating on,"Well I think the businessmodel might look like this.
"I'm not so sure."And his advisers would come back and say,"Let's massage it this way and that."Finally, he's come back and said,"Here's what I think isa billion dollar idea."And everyone said, "Of course.
"Totally makes sense."And so he's off to the races, buildinga company around more likea lumina for neuroscience,is what he believes.
And so it's a big idea,and he had the timeto come up with that, because he wasso capital efficient.
So I think some of these willtake very different paths.
Ideally, they don't spend a lot of moneyin that process, and Ithink the places wherewe as VCs have struggled is, is it big R,little d, or is it little r, big D?And your hope is that you're skewedmore towards development than research.
- Yeah, I guess the lessonfor entrepreneurs thenis you should figure out howto find the right investor.
Because I guarantee you, 90% of the peoplethat Gurjeet pitcheddidn't come at it from a,well my thesis was about big data,so maybe I'm lookingfor, maybe I understandor have empathy for otherpeople who are doing it.
That's interesting.
I think the other thing is that,one other lesson here is that,assume nothing about investors as firms.
Think about investors as people.
Mike and Ann are both very different,just like Reid and I are very different.
We have different backgrounds.
If you do a little bit of research,you can find proclivities and interests,and it's not too hard.
So you just learned alittle bit about Ann'spatience around science.
Now we'll talk aboutmarketplace in just a second,which also requires acertain amount of patience.
But then, and the funnything is, like one thing,you should be carefulnot to assume too much,but you should check interests.
So like everybody in the world assumesbecause of my background at Mozillathat I love investing in web things,and mostly, they makeme terrified right now,because of the rise of mobile.
And actually, a lot of operators who,if you have operating experience,you mostly are terrifiedof investing in that,because you know whereall the bad parts are.
- Yeah, a lot of people...
I mean, like, I actuallyam interested in security.
It was what was area ofresearch for me for my Ph.D.
I haven't made many investmentsin this space becauseit does still scare me.
I feel like I know a little bit too much,but that's an area Iwould still invest in.
Another example is, a lot of people say,"Oh, she did optimizations,"so she's clearly gonna love ad tech."I don't.
- Yeah, Reid went through a periodwhere he couldn't reallylook at a payments companywho had echoes of PayPal.
We would do it now.
VCs always say that.
We say, "We would totallydo it now, just not before."Okay, so let's talk about marketplaces,because marketplaces are special.
It's a special category company.
So let's talk about, 'causeyou have a few investmentsin marketplaces, so TaskRabbitwould be marketplace,the labor marketplace.
Lyft would be in a marketplace.
Modcloth is not, right.
- No, it's more e-commerce.
- Chloe and Isabell is--- It's more e-commerce MLM.
- MLM, okay.
So, let's talk about marketplaces--- Juanillo, might be.
- Yeah, Juanillo kind of, yeah.
So what we talk about is liquidity.
How do you see, I meansomebody asked aboutwhen do you see signs ofwhether it's working or not.
We talk a lot about arethe transactions clearing.
Does that mean, do youmatch a buyer and a seller,how do you tell?And then we talk about how different,difference if it's local orphysical or virtual or whatever,and we look a lot forinflections in liquidity.
How do you think about marketplaces?- Yeah, so at the very early stages,what I found is one of the most importantpieces of a marketplace isnot demand, it's supply.
And so at the very earlystages, we're lookingat how effective are you at convincingsupply to come on board, and how loyalare they to you as a platform,instead of trying to get a customerand then immediately movearound the marketplace as a platform.
And so we're lookingat the supply economicsand how long term that supply wantsto stay on that platformoftentimes, because thatactually leads to demand.
So if you're reallygreat with your supply,and your supply lovesyou and won't leave you,then that means thatyour demand will come.
And so you know, Lyft isa great example of that.
If you turn on your Lyftapp and there are no cars,the likelihood that you'renot going to turn onthe app again suddenly goes up.
And so if you look at sort of the waythey do their marketing,it's tied to how muchthe supply is well rounded in that area.
I think that in TaskRabbitwe saw this as well.
If you have a number of people biddingon a particular job, all of a sudden,to the demand side, it lookslike a really robust communityand so people are more likely to stay.
And so I like to see thatkind of supply dynamicstarting to build in the early stages,'cause that's theleading indicator to whatyou're talking aboutin terms of liquidity.
Because once that happens, thenyou can bring in that demandand you wanna be able to balance it out,but the balancing is a lot easierwhen you just have a lot of peoplewho want to work in that platform.
- Yeah, I think it probably depends onthe type of company.
I think what we talk aboutis you gotta have a thesisabout whether supply or demand matters.
First, make sure you dounnatural things to get thatand then you're hopefully gonnaratchet it up on both sides.
And so let's talk about,along those lines,let's talk about Lyft.
Let's talk about how, can you talk abouthow the, actually, let'scome to Lyft in a second'cause I think people are gonna beinterested in in.
Let's go back to the very beginning again.
So what do you like tosee in founding teams?One of the things we asked Sam,is do you like solofounders, team founders,two, three, 20.
What do you like seeing in founding teams,and what qualities and what number?- Yeah, we tend to, and we've investedin solo founders, but Ithink the healthier dynamicis to have at least two,probably five might be too much,but two is usually a good number.
Three is good as well.
The reason why the solofounder can be really hardis I found that it's very lonely.
And as a result of that, itjust becomes this situationwhere you feel like you can't ever escapeand you're sort of aprisoner to this startup.
And that dynamic can be really,really bad in some ways.
Whereas with a dual team, it's not justthat you're a prisoner to your startup,you feel like this sort of social pressureto stay in the game.
And so you can really sort of focus,both of them, or threeof them, on the problem,and it's sort of a teamwork elementthat I think can be really healthy.
I also know that there'sno superhuman founder.
Every person has a weakness.
To the extent that youcan sort of round outone another's edges, it really can providesort of differentperspectives into the companyor the problems that you're facing.
We like to see sort of that yin and yang.
I look actually even within our own firm,and just the differencesbetween me and Mike,and you just look at usand we look very different.
Obviously, I'm a woman, he's a man.
He's from Texas, I'm from Palo Alto.
He's very white, I'm clearly Asian.
Just our backgrounds, our perspectivescan be very different.
He's a lover, not a fighter.
I'm more of a fighter.
So I'll get mad aboutsomething, and he'll be like,"Whoa, that's not a big deal.
"What are you getting so testy about?"And he can really sort of bring me backwhereas, he won't wannafight about somethingand so when we were negotiating our leasewith our landlord, as an example,I get sent in as the pit bulland then he makes nice afterwards.
So I like that kind of different rolesfor different people,but not having all of itfall on your shoulders,and I imagine for a startupit's like a thousand times worse.
And so we're looking for that.
We do like to look for someonefairly technical in a team as well,because we do thinkthat ends up developinga lot of that proprietary power.
And so if you're a teamwhere you have a lot ofbusiness insights, andyou've entirely outsourcedyour development to Costa Rica,then we probably are lesslikely to invest at that time.
- Yep.
So on the yin and yang about founders.
There's a lot of different opinions.
So a lot of people say,well diversity early,and obviously diversityin the long run's good.
Keith Rabois or maybe PeterThiel is famous for sayingdiverse, you wannahomogenate in the beginningso you can go fast an nothave to fight on everything.
You guys don't worry about homogenating?I tend to think that homogenatingand sort of types ofthinking around vision,around technology approach, that'skind of important.
Is that not too important for you?- I think you have to havean agreement on vision.
So if you're arguing abouteverything in the initial days,I think that's, you just lose time.
So I think it's more about efficiency.
So I think there are sort of fundamentalswithin a company that everyone has to bein agreement on, andmoving in one direction.
That might be on technical stack,like we understand thiskind of technical stack.
But I think diversityin terms of perspectiveis actually pretty valuable.
I don't think you can go from a homogenousorganization to a diverseorganization later on.
I don't think you can make up for that.
I think it's very difficult to.
- That's interesting.
My theory is that I thinkyou can scale it over time.
You introduce diversity,if you wait too long,it becomes very hard,but I think if you start...
It's interesting.
It's an interesting question.
You talked about hiring.
You talked about hiringas an important signalfor you as to whether youwant to invest in somebody?When you invest in small, 'cause sometimesyou invest in tiny companies,couple, three people.
How do you help themfigure out how to hire?Do you?Do you just let them...
- A lot of times, itdepends on the companyso some of our companieswill come back to usfor hiring questions quite a bit,and we're involved in sort of eveninterviewing or closing candidates.
The interesting piece,though, that I foundis they're asking us for candiates.
That's usually problematic.
So most of the time, the best companiesare all finding people internally.
So they're using their employee baseto unlock the greatesttalent that is latentwithin another organizationthat's not even thinking of moving,that's not even thinking of a job.
So our best companies are the ones wherethey're just pickingtalent from great companiesone at a time.
They're like snipers.
The ones that aren't doing as well,they're advertising, they'reputting up job postingseverywhere, and they're tryingto found inbound interest.
And so that's where we try to advise,who, within your team, who do they know?Because there's no onewho's gonna advocatefor a company like someonewho's already working thereand who's completelybought into the vision.
They're gonna be able to say,"I worked with this person two years ago,"and they were thesmartest person I ever met.
"I'm gonna convince thatperson to come work with us."Those are the best hires.
And so we're trying to help our companiesmove in that direction, rather than,here's the recruiters that you use,and these are the jobboards that have beenmost effective.
Those are sort of tacticsthat you can use as wellto augment, butfundamentally, the best onesare internally found.
- Yeah, I think that's my sense too,is that it's a binary bet, which isyou're either a little bit past stuffand you're waiting for inbound peopleto come and talk to you, or you're saying"This is the problem I have to solve"that's critical to my business.
"I'm just gonna go solve this thing."And figure out how to gofind the right people.
And we have the same thing.
I think it's easier intechnically deep companiesto sniper shot.
You can say, "I want thebest NLP search person."You can figure that out.
So if you have other questions,go ahead and raise your hand as we go.
I've got a couple more, andthen we'll just go from there.
So let's talk aboutLyft for a little while,'cause that's one ofthe most famous pivots,well maybe Slack is more famous right now,but Lyft's pivot from where they hadsort of carpooling to what's a little bitmore like Uber became, and actuallyit was before Uber.
I think most people don't know this.
Uber X was really a copy of Lyft.
And so can you talk about what the pivotfelt like and how they knew it was time,and did it feel like running to somethingor what did it feel like?- So Zimride was one of these companiesthat was constantly experimenting.
So they knew they didn'thave product market fit.
What's interesting is theyhad sold this platformto all the UCs.
I think a hundred universitieshad bought this platform.
They'd sold it to Facebook, to Intuit,few corporations.
- [Professor] It was sortof like carpooling, right?- It was for carpooling.
Lawrence Livermore Labs, andso they had sort of this,one hypothesis was ifwe could get all thesecampuses on board, and you could getgeographical coverageof the entire peninsulacampus by campus.
Then all of a sudden, youmight have something here,in interlinked networks.
But that wasn't quite, itwasn't moving fast enough.
It was okay as a business,it wasn't awesome.
So they looked at bus routes, I think,from San Francisco to Tahoe and alsovan routes from San Francisco to LA.
Literally, Logan was rentinga van and driving thembetween San Francisco and LA.
We looked at bus routesand enabling it for buses.
I'm seeing actually alot of the resurgenceof these original hypotheses that we hadas actual individual companies now,which is interesting to see.
But they had tried all of these things,but nothing felt like product market fit.
You would book some people,you'd get some revenues.
It was nice, but it didn't feel huge.
And so Lyft was actuallyjust yet another experiment.
They're like, "Well,mobile's big, and maybe"if we do it P to P it'ssort of sharing the ride."I remember the original idea they pitchedat least me was, "We're gonna have"women drivers and women riders."And by the time I got back to the officethe next time and I hadbeen thinking about this,I'm like, "I think this is too small."They said, "Oh, we've already gotten rid"of that idea, and we'regonna go more broadly."I think there were questions aroundhow big an idea is this?How confident do you guys feel?And I remember there was thisreal moment of intensity.
Logan and John are really nice guysand so you don't getthat, I used to call it,"You need tiger's blood."They wouldn't have that intensitybut they showed thatintensity in that momentand remember Logan was just like,"This is really gonna work.
"You guys have no idea."And so the board said yeah, go for it.
Let's do it.
And I remember thefirst week they launchedwe still had Zimridealongside for a while.
And the first week it launched,I wasn't really paying attention, but thenTommy Leap, who's a Stanford Tree,he came into my office, and he was like,"You have no idea howhuge this is gonna be.
"I took four Lyfts in one day.
"It was amazing."And I was like, "Seriously?"It was that good?"He was like, "It's amazing."And he became this super rider,and whenever we'd go to San Francisco,I'd park the car andI'd take Lyfts around,and it was this kind of magical moment.
But there was this whole Zimride platformhanging over their heads, and I rememberthis one walk where I walked with Loganaround the Giants Park, andwe were walking, walking,and he's talking about,"What should we do about this"additional asset?"Should we move people over onto Lyft,"it's really taking off.
"How may of the peopleshould we move onto Lyft?"And at the end of thatwalk, the conclusion waswe need to move everyone onto Lyft.
And now it would look like a no-brainer,but if you can imagine theposition that these guysare in, you're bought into a vision.
When you pitch people and you've spenttwo, three years of your life,I think at one point before I invested,Logan said he was gonna eat from this hugecan of beans for two weeks, because theydidn't have that much money.
You have sacrificed weekends.
You have sacrificed birthday partiesand time with friends and familyto build this product,and you're essentiallycoming face to face with the realitythat this is not working,and this other thingthat you just built over acouple months is really working.
And you're actually goingto shut this thing down.
That actually takes a lot of courage.
It takes a lot of, it's thishuge come to Jesus momentthat I think is really hard to appreciate,and I appreciate the courage that it tookfor them to move aggressivelyin that direction.
- It's actually hard even to see.
'Cause there's gonnabe a bunch of HBS casestudies and stuff aboutLyft in the future,and what's gonna happen is say, well look,here's this thing thatwas moving like this,and here's this otherthing moving like this.
And so of course they shutdown the thing moving like thisand they jump on thething moving like this,but we have so many cognitive biases--- But it was causal.
- It's causal and youdon't really wanna say,this thing that I've been working on,I should definitely lookfor ways to shut this down.
You actually don't,it's hard to even see itbecause in your head, you'reso committed to the thing.
- Yeah.
And you've sold yourinvestors on this vision.
You've sold yourself andyour employees this visionfor a long time, and so Ithink that when people saypivot and they've changedthe color on a button,it's not pivot.
Pivot is actually, likeyou're gonna throw upbecause of the ideathat you have to do it.
- And so did they order a thousandpink mustaches right on that day?What happened?Do you guys remember this?All the cars had pink mustaches.
- They had this outsource guy.
He must have been like, "Oh my gosh,"I have won the lottery."- Pink mustache guy.
- All the sudden they're getting all thesepink mustache orders.
I think eventually they boughtthem out and he's in-house.
- In-house pink mustache guy.
How big do you have tobe before you need a guyin-house for your pink mustaches?- You wanted the cuddle 'stache,and then you wanted differentversions of the 'stache.
- Did they run that by the board,or did cars just with pink mustachesjust start showing up?- No, I think they mentioned itand I think everyone was like,"Oh, it's interesting."Why pink?- Sure.
- [Student] How did the management teammaintain employee faithwhile going throughthis pretty uncommon transition?- Good question.
- Well you have to remember--- So the question was, how did the teammaintain faith whenyou're changing so much.
- Yeah, so the entire team was fairlybought into all these experimentsthat they were running,so they were used to, ohhere's another experimentthat they're gonna run.
I think the big shift wasthey actually had a salesteam that was selling this platformto universities andcorporations, and essentiallyyou have to shutter thatand move everyone into,you're gonna operate this marketplace,which is, it's so different,but at the same time,I think you get faith fromthe fact that you haveproduct market fit.
They weren't just like, "Oh my gosh,"we need drivers.
"Let's get as many drivers as we can."I think in the early days,we had gone to TaskRabbitand said, oh you have some ofthese people who are drivingpeople to airports.
Is it possible to use some of those peopleas drivers?And so, it was just sort of this shiftthat when you saw it taking off,I think everyone was bought in.
- [Student] So how do you think,given kind of Uber'srise in the marketplace,how do you think aboutLyft in the frameworkof all the things youwere talking about before?- Yeah, I think they havea lot of the elementsthat we were talking about.
One of the things that I'vealways loved about Lyft--- [Professor] The question was--- Oh, sorry.
- [Professor] What doyou do, so Uber seems--- Uber, Uber's kind of--- [Professor] Yeah, Uber, Uber.
- It's interesting.
We never talk about Uber.
(laughter)I've always thought aboutcompanies as being different,not better, and I thinkthat if you look at it,actually there are other competitorsthat did this P to P ride sharing stuff.
And the reason why Lyft has maintaineda great advantage here in certain pocketsand markets, is becausethey're really different.
And one of the keydifferences was when you firsttook a Lyft, in the early days especially,you had the fist bump, the pink mustache.
It wasn't just everyone's private driver.
It was such a differentiated experience,which is part of why Uber had to respond.
But that community element has stayed,and if you talk to drivers,if you talk to reallylong time users of Lyft, you'll censorwhat that community element feels like.
I also think that sort ofthe irreverence of the brandfor a long time, has really createda differentiated appeal.
I think it's partially whyI Lyft Line works so well.
If you're in the city and you try it out,it's an incredible product.
I've met incredible peopleriding on a Lyft Line.
I also thought that whatwas interesting to mewas, it's a experience thattranslates generationally,so my dad actually hada triple bypass surgery,and my mom and I both weren't availableto take him to a doctor'sappointment at one point.
And so I gave him this training on Lyft.
I said, "Time comes, you press this button"and someone's gonna show up.
"And you just get in the car.
"You can sit in the front,you can sit in the back,"whatever you feelcomfortable with, you go."And gets back and hecalls me, and he says,"What an incredible experience.
"You press a button andthe nicest man showed"up at my door with a beautiful Prius"that was newer than mineto take me to the hospital.
"And he asked me about my life,"and if I was feelingokay," which is like,not his experience he's ever hadin any other setting,and for someone who is76 or 77 years old, tofeel that difference,to me, I feel like that'ssomething that's very defensible.
I also believe that with them,it's a marketplace model,and obviously there is ahuge battle for supply.
And they all have theirdifferent tactics for winning itand part of it has becomedo you fixate locally?So do we fixate domestically in the US?Do you fixate internationally for growth?And Lyft has obviously picked their battleand how they're gonna go about doing that.
And so it's different, it'sa different approach, andI think that's the thing thatwe remain optimistic about.
- Okay, I think we havetime for two more questions.
It's you in the back.
You can armwrestle.
- [Student] When you areinvesting in foundersand companies, are youinvesting in their knowledgeabout the specific market,or are you investingmore in the fact thatthey're quick learnersand that they're adaptive?Does that make sense?- The question was, whenyou invest in founders,are you investing in the fact that theyhave deep knowledge or deep expertise,or the fact that they'requick learners and can adapt.
- [Student] Yeah, likewhat if they just hadthe idea, but knewnothing about the market?But you just think they have a good ideaand think that they will learn.
Which one, do you takethose factors into account?- Yeah, we would, but I think that,to some extent, we canwait until another foundershows up who has both.
And so, because we're not investingin a ton of different companies,we're actually fairly selective,so I'll probably make fourinvestments in one year.
And so if you have onevery deep, and you're not,if I were to say whichone I would weight more,I would say someone who'sgonna be sort of fast.
And quick learner means more thatthey're willing toexperiment and make mistakesand move on.
But again, having some authentic insightinto that market is better,and so we would prefer to see both.
- What I'll tell you is that the market'sefficient enough now.
There's enough capitaland enough entrepreneursthat almost anything isnot an obvious decision.
So what my experience has been,'cause the pricing'sdifferent or whatever it is,but my experience has been that whenI'm warming up to an investment,I'll fall in love withit, and then I will fallinto deep hate with it, andthen I'll fall in love with it,then I'll fall way out of love.
So I'll, like, this isthe best thing ever, likeoh my god, if I invest inthis I might go to jail,and you vacillate wildly,and then at the end it comes,and you make a call, andthen you usually throw upafter you make the call,and it sounds ridiculousfor an investor to say, but it's nervewracking on our side, too.
And so I would just sayyou vacillate wildlyand it's a mixture of things.
And obviously the moregood things you have,the better, but everything's got issues.
- Yeah, I think the keything is most of these thingsare controversial.
So in the early days, ifit's not controversial,there's so many people already workingon that very same idea, that you probablydon't have the space to win.
And so there's somethingabout the business,as I said, it's less than50% chance of working,and so, and you'll gothrough these wild swingsof like, "Of course I believe in it.
"It's amazing.
"It's gonna totally work."And then you're like, "Oh my gosh,"I'm such an idiot.
"Why do I wanna write a check?"And then you go back to, "But I love it.
"This is totally gonna be amazing."And you have these wild swings.
If you didn't have that, and especiallywithin our partnerships,it's just two voices,and oftentimes, the best ones are the oneswhere Mike is like, "I don't get it.
"I don't see it at all.
"That's the stupidest thing I've heard."And I'm like, "Well,I'm gonna do it anyway."And the opposite has happened as well,where he says, I'm poundingthe table, and I'm likethat is so ridiculous, andI'll literally make funof the idea, and he says,"Still wanna do it."Those are the best ones.
- [Professor] Airbnb,Facebook were both very, verycontentious in our partnership.
They seem obvious now.
Last question.
- I said no, we passed on Airbnb.
- [Professor] Yeah, well it's likeyou're renting out somebody's room.
It's so weird.
- Well they had more money off of cerealthan they did from...
- [Professor] Yeah, last question.
- [Student] So product market fitis the gate to category dominance?But to what extent beconcerned that some thingsmight have a great product market fitin Silicon Valley, inCalifornia, in the United States,but not to a global audience,and consumer softwareis kind of dependent on aglobal audience at some point.
- Yeah.
I would say, actually forconsumer, US audience--- Question is how much do you worryabout product market fitis local or geographicallybased and not more broad.
- So yeah.
Geographically based, we, if it's localwe really worry.
So one of the things thatMike and I often talk aboutis, is this a blue statewine sipper businessor does it have a chance of beinga beer slammer red state business?And we prefer businesses where we can saythat's red state, beer slammer business,because too often, we'llfind businesses thatcater to the triathlete,VC, who loves to drink winethan, that's great, but that'sreally not gonna translateoutside of a few people.
So that's something that wedo very much pay attention to.
International versus US.
