- [John] Okay, good,
so thanks, third week,
so the first couple weeks, no surprise,
a lot of people knew the material.
We intentionally went
and found three investors
that we thought were
important, and impressive,
and we respect a lot,
Ann and Michael and Sam,
to give different perspectives on how they
think about the work, how
they think about startups,
and I think a lot of
the feedback we got was
you can see a lot of
themes that we're saying,
some of the repetition
and people wanted more
and more specificity.
So today you're going to
get a ton of specificity.
We're going to talk a lot about Mozilla,
which is a story that I know really well,
and I'll explain in great
detail why it's important
in this new phase, the OS2
sort of 15-150 person stage.
And I'd like this to be as
interactive as possible,
so you're not going to
find a person who knows
quite a lot much better than I do,
and so lots of questions would be good.
And then, so we'll do a little recap,
we'll do a little into to OS2,
we'll do a lot of Mozilla,
and then Allen's going to have a lot
of specifics around
scaling and resourcing.
And one of the things
you're gonna find is that
there's abstract comments
that are actually abstract,
there are specific comments
that sound abstract,
and then there's specific concepts
that don't generalize that well.
And so we're going to talk about a lot
and the trick will be, you know,
we're going to go into
a lot of specificity,
and generalizing out from
that, that'll be the key.
But I think you will
find that, especially now
as you move from investors to operators,
things are going to start
moving more and more quickly
and more and more specifically.
And then we'll prep for
Thursday, that's it.
So, let's make this as
interactive as we can,
so what themes did people feel
like were very, very common
across Sam, Ann, and Michael,
in the last couple of weeks?
- Move fast.
- Move fast and specifically
make decisions quickly, right?
What else?
- A relentless and realistic user focus.
- User focus, right, so making sure
that you build something
people care about.
- Fa-rfasting make sure you're managing
your personal far-fast
- Far-fast, was that a
theme that was common?
I don't remember
Sam did, yeah, Michael
maybe did, too, yep.
So Far-fast, far quickly.
Are there themes that were common?
- Don't start a company unless
it's bursting out of you.
- Yeah don't start a company
unless it's bursting outta ya.
I think you each got a different flavor
of that specific comment.
Other things that were common?
- Don't do it alone.
Unless that's the deal, yeah.
Unless you are alone, yeah.
Yep, that's a good comment, yep.
(laughter)
- Forever alone.
- The authenticity of the founding story.
- Yeah, authenticity
of the founding story,
that's interesting.
I guess that did come up,
certainly with Michael,
less so with Ann and Sam, right?
Other things that were--
- [Male student] Sam talked about it.
- Yeah? Okay, good.
- Just a strong focus on
product, product development,
product market fit, and
ignoring everything else.
- Yeah, what to ignore is a key.
I think everybody who's gone
through this journey realizes
that you're tryin' to
pile about pounds of work
into about a three pound bag,
and so figuring out which
three pounds to take with you is key.
So let's go to the board.
So here's the ones that, oh, yeah,
So what was most divergent
across the three of them?
Was there anything that was divergent?
(audio muffled)
Yeah, diversity and how
much diversity matters,
I think is a key.
I think, actually, its a
pretty controversial topic
everywhere.
I think people don't have a good sense
of what the real benefits
and costs of diversity are
so early.
What else was divergent?
(audio muffled)
Yeah, that's right, so
Ann had a structured theme
which was how do you build
proprietary advantage,
proprietary power, whereas Sam
just wants you to build
things that people love.
Yeah, I think Sam has
a much simpler frame,
and it actually matches
why commentator stream
in a lot of ways, build
things that people love,
the rest of it works out.
We'll see, there's lots
of ways that that's true,
and lots a ways that it's not so true.
The other things that were divergent?
- The early financing structure, some like
(audio drowned out by
instructor's laughter)
- Yeah, so Sam invented Safe
Notes which Michael hates,
that's true.
You guys really liked
the financing discussion,
that was surprising but I guess
shouldn't be that
surprising in retrospect.
Financing is not that
interesting, but we can talk about
it a little bit more if you guys want to.
So, yeah, sure.
(audio muffled)
Oh, interesting, so Michael
and Reid diverged a little bit
on how to make decisions
inside the company.
When he said Michael,
said let the markets win,
Reid says
(audio muffled)
- Yeah, internal market.
I wonder if Micheal really meant that.
I mean, Michael really,
really believes in markets.
Really, really.
And Reid like really
believes in how smart he is
as a single founder and people like him
and it turns out it's pretty true.
People like Reid are very good
at making decisions very fast.
So that's interesting,
interesting difference.
Other divergences?
Alright, let's move forward then.
- Sure. Oops.
Alright, so let's ed.
We talked about a bunch of
things in the sort of OS1 phase
which is this small phase.
But things are about to move more quickly.
Just to remind you where we are,
we have five phases we were
talking about during the quarter
so we talked about the
OS1 phase quite a bit.
We're gonna do basically
two weeks on each of these,
and we're changing our focus right now
to what makes OS2, organizational
skill two, what it is.
Those numbers, again, are just ballparks,
they're just like ways in
which you can sort of identify
kind of roughly where
somebody actually is.
But I think one of the
things which really changes
what you're focusing on.
So, when we talked about OS1,
this is basically what
we were talking about.
So got to identify a
non-obvious market opportunity
where you have a unique
advantage or approach.
Right, so you remember when
Ann went through her types
of power in an organization?
She talked about proprietary power.
In a lot of ways, this unique
advantage or unique market
is a great example of proprietary power.
And it's actually a big component.
This is essentially proprietary power
and the second one is product power,
that ability to build custom
fit between the product
and the market.
Just as an example, just to
remind people sort of where
we are, if you're talking
about Linkedin and this,
what we're talking about
was we had a market,
it was basically thought
it was every professional,
every professional would be doing a search
on a regular basis.
Our unique approach was
to build a social network
in order to build up a
huge search base in order
to allow people to do it,
and our product market fit
was with people who wanted to search.
Again, we thought that was everybody,
it turns out that it turned
out to be recruiters for us.
But that's an example
of those various pieces.
So now you've got this plan
and you've got this notion of value.
People have read The Lean Startup I assume
Eric, when he talks about
He talks about two concepts
you need to test early
in the process.
The first one is a value hypothesis.
The value hypothesis is:
can I actually provide value
to people who are in my market?
The second one is the growth hypothesis
and the growth hypothesis is:
okay, we've got a product
market fit, we've got value,
how are we actually gonna
get to the next scale?
So, this is really the message for OS2.
The core concept is: I've got
something which is working
in the market, how do I effectively get it
to a large market scale?
So pretty much everything
we're gonna be talking about
when we talk about OS2 scale companies,
is how you go from a great idea
with good product market fit
but in a limited space getting
out to extremely broad growth
and basically delivering
that value to everybody.
There are three parts of
basically what you need to do.
So the first one is you need
to create a plan for growth,
you need to execute and
learn from it, rethink it,
and build market share.
So there's a lot of information
about this, Eric talks about
it in his book, we're gonna
be talking about it today,
specifically about how Mozilla grew.
The second thing is
you need to adjust your
product market fit as you go along,
'cause you're gonna learn things about it.
One thing which is crazy
about all this stuff
is that everything you think
you know about your plan
and everything you think you know
about your product market
fit, is up for debate.
So you're gonna learn that
and the importance of being
able to learn effectively
from the situation
and react to it quickly,
is truly essential.
The third thing you have to
worry about is you have to worry
about competition 'cause
you're now in a position
where you're actually
probably have other start-ups
who know who you are and
know what you're working on
and find the space your
in actually interesting.
The question is, how do you
actually make sure you get the
market share before they're
able to get the market share?
And I know this is a big
component of what we're actually
talking about today with Mozilla.
The key component of this
is being able to move
really, really quickly.
Okay, so this is the basic
goal for OS2 and what you
actually do achieve.
How do you do it?
Well you kinda have to become the tribe.
You need to have more resources
to be able to get things done,
so it means a bigger team
in order to learn and build effectively.
It means new functions that
you haven't had to have before
because you need to interact
with customers at a large scale
whether you're not a
price offer or consumer
Go ahead.
- This is on the previous
slide, I'm just curious
with the competition stuff,
were there certain things
that early competitors to
Linkedin that you, in hindsight,
realize that they'd been
wrong? Specifically?
- So we can talk about this
So we had exactly the situation with--
- [John] So the question was.
- I'll repeat the question.
Were there early competitors to Linkedin?
Basically people who we saw or we think we
And why'd they mess up?
So yes, the answer is
yes, there were a bunch.
When we launched Linkedin
within two or three months
there were three other
competitive products,
all of which were heading
for the same space,
which entered the market during that time.
(audio muffled)
They were all Tier 1, they
were all tiny little companies
that were trying to
build product market fit.
- [John] None of 'em scaled fast enough.
- And none of 'em scaled fast enough.
- [John] It's a race to scale.
- It's a race to scale and the reason
that it actually worked out
for us and it didn't work out
for them is because we
took this very seriously.
This idea that you have to grow
in order to generate value.
They moved very quickly
to advanced features
and they moved very quickly
to how do I monetize this?
Without actually locking in
the market share necessary
to make the thing successful.
So they were trying to
build features on top of
and try to sell the product
before they actually had
effective value to sell.
And that meant we got to
continue to concentrate on growth
which is how we were able
to exit the OS2 phase
and move one.
They actually did different
stuff a little bit,
so two of them did that.
One of them had an approach
which simply didn't work
and there was a fourth
one which basically had
actually two of them had
approaches that didn't work.
One of them thought the entire
social graph lived inside
the enterprise, it's called visible path.
And basically, it's whole
idea was mine people's e-mail
to discover what those
connections are and auto-generate
your group social graph.
The problem was that in order
to do that, they had to get
inside each company and
inside each e-mail service
to be able to actually make
it happen, so it was too slow.
The other one was called
Spoke and Spoke was entirely
focused on one vertical
and not a diverse network.
It was only for salespeople.
So basically no one else
wanted to be part of it.
So they couldn't effectively
grow, they had built something
into their approach which
prevented them from growing.
- [John] But another piece
I think, if you wanna talk
about a lot here is that it's
the little confusing figuring
out who your competition is.
- Do you wanna step down
so they can see you?
- Okay, so I remember in
2007, I was with Reid,
talking about his growth and
he was really, really thinking
about how to grow faster Linkedin
because they clearly left
Spoke and those guys behind at that point,
but Facebook was what he
was thinking about a lot.
It was like why are we growing,
I don't even remember, 2007.
- In 2007 we had about
three and a half million,
four million.
- So looking at Facebook, it
was like Facebook's growth
is much, much faster, do we need to get
on our trajectory there?
Or do we need to go to
college and that kinda stuff
and Facebook looked
like a clear competitor,
which in hindsight was not right.
Facebook isn't really
competitive, it's separate--
- [Allen] It's quasi competitive.
- [John] Right.
- [Allen] Yep.
- Along those same lines,
I think we talk a lot
about product market
fit, like someone said
build something users will
love, but how do you address
market choice being
really more of a choice
that you're making about
who are your competitors?
(audio distorts)
- So the question is, you
sometimes choose your market
and you choose your
competitors at some level,
but the truth is you don't really do that
so much as your customers do, but...
- Well, this actually goes
back to the very first idea
up here, is this non-obvious
market opportunity
with unique approach is actually the bet
that everybody makes at the beginning.
You have a market you're
actually trying to reach,
you have a unique way to do it.
The question is, is your way
going to be more successful
than this way over here?
You are in fact choosing the
competitors and basically,
defining the competitive space
when you pick your approach.
For Linkedin it was build
a social network in order
to build a huge search base.
Which was different than the so--
(audio muffled)
So, kinda depends, I'll
tell ya what happened
in Linkedin's case.
- The question is the balance
between what the founders
think is the market and
what users are telling them
is the market.
- Yeah, so the really
challenging thing for Linkedin
was that we actually had,
truth be told, pretty weak
product market fit in the early days.
This is one of the reasons we didn't grow
and when we get to the end
we'll talk about growing
through value which matters a huge amount.
Facebook, any messaging
platform you look at right now,
they're all growing through value.
The reason there are 700
million people using WhatsApp
is because people, to get their value,
they attract their
friends into the system.
That didn't exist on Linkedin
because the value was search.
We started with an empty
search base and the growth
of Linkedin was to build
the search base in order
to get the product market fit.
So in some ways, we didn't
have a feedback loop
which was telling us what
the value was except saying,
there's no one here who I wanna find.
And so that's what we
basically paid attention to
is we trusted our original
approach but all we could do
is we just move forward and say
we're gonna get the value someday.
- So there's some people (audio muffled)
- Yep.
Yep.
You know what, we had
potential product market fit.
Yeah because we had
identified, for instance,
recruiters are a great example.
Recruiters absolutely loved
the concept of the product
but the problem is when
they went and searched,
the search base was too small.
But the product market
fit was actually there
but only with this specific
people who could envision
what it would be like when
we had a ton of people
on the network.
- So did you guys focus
on new growth aspects?
- Exactly.
(audio muffled)
Yes.
So the question is in what
cases does it make sense
to focus on growth rather than
focus on product market fit?
I would really, I think that
the Linkedin case was actually
a fairly unique one,
but I don't know, John,
you can talk to, more examples--
- If you get the product
right, get the product right.
Focusing on growth before
you get the product right
is a excellent way to
just lay a ton of money.
- Just keep pouring it in
and people just don't use it
and that problem got more
and more and more acute
as the number of start-ups has exploded.
- And the only reason we
did it is because we knew
that we had to get the
growth before we could get
to product value.
- And they found their
super-users, so Linkedin found--
- [Allen] And we'll talk
about that in a little bit.
- Yeah, so we'll wait, so hold this thing
we'll come back to it.
- So three things you need
to do, becoming a tribe
requires you to bring on new
capabilities and new services
which means expanding the group.
Certain kinds of
investments in technology.
Business operations.
Basically, now that you've
got between 10 and 50 people
in the company, you
need to have an office,
you need to have keys and so people
can get into the damn office.
The reason this is important
is that basically you're kinda
setting up two teams,
so you have team one,
which is basically the team
which is working on the scale
and the growth.
Then you've got team two,
which is defending team one.
Team two is there to
make sure the founders
and the engineers don't get
distracted by having to deal
with things like ordering
food in on a regular basis.
So we got two, that's what number three is
and then the right financing
and capital allocation
because at some point you're gonna need
to pay all these people a salary.
Your financial needs are
different in the world of OS2
than they were in OS1.
So that, we should talk about Mozilla.
- Okay, so we're gonna talk
about Mozilla for a little while
now so it's gonna be
about 30 or 40 minutes.
So please ask questions all along the way.
As I was going through this
I went back to board decks
and some other things
I'm gonna share actual
board decks with you,
so we'll talk about some specifics.
What I realized is the world
is so different in 2015
than in 2004 when Firefox
launched, I need to explain
it a little bit.
So, we're just gonna talk about
the period from 2005 to 2008
there's other interesting
stuff on both sides of that
but this is the period we'll talk about.
So here's some context.
So 2004, nobody's gonna
remember this, instead of Max
out there, actually most people
actually didn't have laptops
in class so much in 2004, but a few did,
but they were all Windows
and IE was something like
95% market share.
And this is not an exaggeration,
95, 96% market share
and that's what that looks like.
So, not only did they have
market share, they also had
100% dominate distribution
which is IE came bundled
on your machine, so you got a
machine, and you got a browser
and there was no app store and
there was no nothing really,
and so if you wanted something
else, you have to say.
You have to make a decision,
you have to say I don't want
this thing, I want another
thing that's like it
and I'm gonna go find it to get it.
Which sounds ridiculous in
2015 but that's where it was.
And so most people, Microsoft included,
said, well, the browser's done.
Microsoft killed Netscape,
Microsoft killed AOL,
they launched IE and in fact,
Microsoft disbanded most
of the IE team after this.
They moved them on to
something called Silverlight,
which obviously was super important.
(laughter)
I make that joke a lot, so
it's kind of a cheap shot,
but whatever.
I like Microsoft better now than I used to
but they really, it's like they
had the mission accomplished
banner, it's like, okay, we won
the web, let's move from IE6
which we launched in
2001 and then moved off
and they really didn't
launch IE7 until something
like six years later.
That's an amazing, amazing thing.
So by the end of 2004,
Mozilla had built Firefox 1.0
and I guess I should mention
some things about Mozilla.
So this was an unlikely thing to matter.
Most people had decided
Mozilla didn't care by 2004
because Mozilla actually started
in 1998 as part of Netscape
and this is like a pretty prehistory.
But a lot for me, all as I
was putting this together,
all seems exactly like yesterday.
I can see all these decision points.
For all you it seems like
prehistory from when you were kids
or before you were born,
maybe, naw, probably not
before you were born, close.
But so for Mozilla, it was
this open-source project
inside Netscape and they
way the Mozilla started
was a guy named Bob Lisbon who was running
the Netscape project, he
was thinking about how
to compete with Microsoft,
and this is a big,
this is a really important lesson.
He was up late, late one
night, and he was worried
that Netscape wasn't gonna
keep pace with Microsoft,
and Microsoft is hiring a
ton of people and starting
to spend more and more and
more engineering resources
and so software used to have
this thing called Botbox
and the Botbox would list
the engineer's names on it
who worked on it.
And so one night, he went
through the Microsoft products
that he competed with from the Netscape GM
and he started counting
each of the people's names.
And he had 200 people working
on products at Netscape
and he quit when he got
to about 2,500 people
he had counted at Microsoft.
And so from him, he looks at
it they have more than 10 times
the people we have in 1998,
there's no way for us to
compete, symmetrically.
And so we have to figure out
how to do something different.
And so from Bob, and this is
well before my time in Mozilla,
but from Bob what I learned
is this idea, you have to
compete asymmetrically
in a market that exists.
You cannot compete on the same field.
And so like the war
metaphor is you have to be
more like the Americans,
not the British, more GMI
just be gorillas.
Gorilla is GUER not
GORI but both are good.
So anyway, so that was Bob
and they had started this
open-source project and the
open-source project of Mozilla
they really wandered around the wilderness
for a long, long time.
They had this thing called
the Mozilla Suite which
was a browser and an HG
monitor and an e-mail client
because obviously you
want all those things,
everybody who's browsing
the web obviously needs
an HG e-mail editor.
That was the freak thing.
I swear to God, this is
what the world was like.
You think I'm joking, but
and your e-mail client
was H-mail, whatever.
So you'd pull forward and in 2003 and 2004
there was a split in the
Mozilla project and some people
Blake Cross and some others.
What their inside was is that maybe
what people wanted was
not an HG mail editor,
maybe they just wanted a fast browser.
And that's when Firefox was
born and that was a very, very
contentious debate.
By the end of 2004,
November 2004, they came out
with Firefox 1.0 and it was
kind of a lightning bolt.
There had been no new browsers really.
This is the part where the opera
guys will start to complain
and I'll talk about that in a second.
But really no new important
browsers for a number of years.
And this is what it was, it
was fast, pop-up blocking,
tab browsing, and innovative search.
The feature that most people
came for was pop-up blocking
and anybody who's
browsing the web in 2004,
you'd browse for a few
hours and you'd have 200,
literally 200 little
windows pop up with ads
back before content blockers.
The sustainable feature
is that people really
loved tab browsing and
Mozilla was really the browser
that popularized tab browsing.
This is the part where the
opera guys really scream 'cause
they probably came up with
it first, it's hard to tell.
But the trigger was that IE was insecure.
So as a consequence of IE
not investing in their team,
Internet Explorer Anonymous
and their team Microsoft,
they had security holes
and so US security,
a part, an arm of the
government said you should
not just use IE, you should
have IE plus something.
And so there was important
product design happening
but there was a hot trigger that happened
that enabled it to succeed.
So the key here though, is
the product is important,
but not enough.
So competing asymmetrically
is the other thing.
So they launched in November
of 2004 and naturally,
they launched an ad.
This is the craziest
thing, and it's the story.
Mozilla said, well we're gonna launch.
We don't have any money, but
we have a lot of community.
We have a lotta people
who work on this with us.
It's an open-source
project, we have localizers
in every country, so we're
just gonna do a fundraise.
And this is one of the
funny things about history
is that anytime you have
a weird idea that works,
like within a few months it
becomes not a weird idea at all,
it becomes the status quo.
And so this was a Kickstarter
campaign essentially,
well before Kickstarter
and so that doesn't seem
like a shocking development.
This was a shocking development.
So what Mozilla did is they
ran a thing for 30 days
and said if you send us
$10, we'll put your name
in the New York Times.
And so if you look at that...
So that's what happened in New York Times.
What they said is, we
know people love Firefox,
and it turns out they
raised twice as much money
as they needed, and so
they had a second page,
which was actually an ad
you could actually read.
But they shipped this in November
and it got so much attention
and a couple things happened.
Number one, everybody who's name was in it
went and bought a New
York Times and showed
it to their mom or their dad
and said, look, look, look,
my name's in the New York Times.
And then the second thing that happened,
is that we got a bunch of
process stories written.
And a process story is
not about Firefox itself,
but it's like, look what
this crazy company is doing
to get attention.
So there were a lotta stories
about us using this ad.
And so there was just a
big boom and it resulted
in 10 million downloads
in the first month.
So the key for us was that,
and this is before I got there,
but the key was that
Mozilla was the community.
It was the community.
That's the asymmetric advantage.
The way to take advantage
of that, is let people see
themselves in Mozilla and help them help.
Give them tools so they can
help, so they can proselytize,
so they can evangelize, and
what happened as a result,
is that people felt
ownership because they say,
my $10, I sent it in,
my name is in the paper,
now I wanna go put Firefox
on my library computers
and my school computers
and that's literally
how it spread and became a
little bit of a movement.
And a lotta the language
that early Mozilla used,
and a lotta the techniques
they used, were derived
from a lotta the things
that political campaigns do.
Grassroots campaigns.
And again, this was off the core insight,
which the community was
everything for Mozilla.
Yes, Chris?
(audio muffled)
Yeah, so Chris's question
was, was doing stuff similair
as political campaigns
and grassroots campaigns
by design? or was it accidental?
They looked at the Howard Dean campaign
which nobody's gonna
exactly remember (laughter)
But the Howard Dean campaign was special
because it was one a the first
campaigns that raised retail,
raised money retail, raised
money in 10, 50, 100 dollar
increments and so they
really understood how to
They made a real connection
until Howard Dean did this thing
in a forum like this
where he made funny noise
and his campaign went
like this after that.
Like that after this.
But yeah, it was very
intentional and then later,
the Obama For America campaign in 2008
took a lot of cues from
both the growth of Facebook
and the growth of Mozilla
and that informed a lot
of how I think technology spread now,
which I think seems obvious
which is it looks like political
and social spread as
much as anything else.
Sure.
Yeah, well hang on a second.
So the question was how and
why did the initial community
form to get to that point, I'll
get to that in just a second
so a key, let people see
inside and this was successful.
The launch worked, 10 million
downloads in the first 30 days
which 10 million was a
big number even then.
Growth is super strong, the
financials are super strong
because of another thing that happened
which is the product.
The Mozilla folks realized
very early is that search
is becoming a first-class
way to access the web.
It used to be just a
URL bar where you typed
the long URL and what they realized
is that more and more people
were typing just words
into search.
And this is early, this is a
time before it was obviously
Google was gonna win,
it was Google and Yahoo
were the two and I'll talk
about it in just a second.
And they built Google and Yahoo and search
into the search box.
So Mozilla was the first browser I think
to have a search box in the top right.
And worked a deal with
Google to be able to pay for
ads and clicks basically.
And so as a result, the
financials were strong,
very, very clear product market fit
and only 15 people in the organization.
There was many, many more
people outside the organization,
'cause there'd been a long
period of build-up where you
had probably hundreds of people
contributing source code,
outside the organization,
you had dozens of localizers,
localizing into French and
Italian and German and Polish,
and then lots and lots
of people took ownership
by a campaign called Spread
Firefox, which I'll show you
which was if you wanna
make this thing work,
you all should help us spread it.
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, the question was,
how do you convince,
and security is kinda
amorphous historic benefit
and how do you convince
users that they should care?
The press did it for us.
Wahl Mossburg did a review,
that said Firefox 1.0
is incredible and it happens
to not be insecure like IE.
And you get a lotta that stuff
and so it's very, very hard
to say.
For you to say well, we're super secure.
Much, much easier for other
people to talk about it.
And one a the things about Mozilla
You know, one of the commonalities
in the first sessions
was people said don't buy into the PR,
PR, you know someone in PR?
Mozilla was not like that,
so like we felt community
and messaging and PR, partly
due to the guy who's CEO now,
he's Chris Beard which is
just strong communication,
strong messaging and
direct to the audience
was always gonna be the way to do it.
And so we had a lotta
people telling it for us
and so you said, well if you
want Spread Firefox to win,
tell your school principal,
tell the IT guy at school
that Firefox is more secure.
Tell the library administrators
it's more secure, and
that really caught in a way
that security doesn't usually.
That's right.
So this is what I got there
and I'll just tell a brief
little story to illustrate
what part of our product
market fit feels like.
So, I was actually looking
for a different job
so in 2005 I had left my
start-up and I wanted to do VC
and turns out being a VC
is kind of fairly quirky
job-seeking process.
Super, super quirky.
And I went to Mozilla to
help because I knew Mitchell
from another board that I was on.
And I went in to see them,
maybe three months, four months
after Firefox had launched
because I was on another board
with her and she always seemed very tired.
I'm like, how's it going?
And she's like, there's a lot
going on, I'm really tired,
I gotta go, bye.
And so I just went to visit
Mozilla and I went in, I had
this amazing session where
she said, here's all the stuff
that's happening, here's
all the help we need,
how can you help us?
And I'm like okay, let me think about it.
So I went home 'cause I
was unemployed at the time
and so I did a PowerPoint
and this seems ridiculous
in retrospect, so I did a
little PowerPoint, so I go,
here's what I think you should
do, I think you should think
about this and this,
here's a framework for you
to think about it and I
sent it back to Mitchell,
who's the founder of
Mozilla and then Chris Beard
who's now the CEO and I
heard nothing back from them.
And one of the things is
when you're unemployed
like time goes super slowly,
you're like, ah I wonder
if they got my mail,
maybe they don't like me,
what's wrong with them?
Is something wrong with me?
Do they not like what I was doing?
And so like, I just sent
a PowerPoint deck to
like an open-source project,
that was probably wrong.
So I went back, I had
another session with them
and it was an amazing
session, we talked about
all the things they could do
and all the ways that they
could go from there and like
ah-ha, this time I went home,
this time not a PowerPoint,
so I wrote a long e-mail
about all the things they
should do and I sent it
and two weeks, nothing.
And I'm like, well, what the hell?
Do they just not care?
Are they schizophrenic?
Do they like me in person and not like me?
Like are they conflict-avoidant
and don't want to tell me
they don't like me?
It was very weird, it
was very weird I thought.
And you know, being unemployed
you're very self-conscious
and you're not quite sure what's going on.
And so I went back and I
just started showing up.
And I said, well, if they're
not gonna answer my mail,
there's something
important happening here,
so I'm just gonna start
showing up and helping.
And this is not, this is
definitely not what I want,
I don't wanna work for a
non-profit, open-source,
granola thingy, but I
can help a little bit.
So I started showing up and
then Reid and I were talking
about it a lot and to
Reid's credit, he's like,
you know what's happening?
This is working, like this
is a good thing to join.
And he and I debated it for a
little while and then I made
probably the best career
decision which is decided,
well, I threw up my hands
and I decided I would join.
But I was still on the fence
and I remember this again
it was like 10 or 12 people
and it shows how busy it was
and how much the wheels
were coming off the place.
So Mitchell and Brendan, the co-founder
of the immature Javascript and then Chris,
the head of marketing and
product, but now CEO in 2015.
They were going to see Jerry
Yang at Yahoo and so they said,
well, why don't you come along?
John the guy who's kind of a
consultant just hanging around.
And so little weird, right?
So this is gonna be interesting
meeting, just come with us.
And so we go and we go
for an hour long meeting
and 45 minutes in, Jerry hadn't
shown up yet and Jerry was
like, I don't know, CTO
or cheif strategy officer
or something like that of Yahoo,
he's a pretty important guy.
And 45 minutes he didn't show
up, he had his people there,
we were making small talk
but then he comes in at
45 minutes and he started
yelling at us almost immediately.
And I kinda tuned out,
it was a funny thing,
so Jerry's a lovely guy
and he's a good friend
and we invest together and
he built this nice building
over here, and he's a
really nice guy but he was
really angry, really angry at us.
And what he was angry about
is that Google was built
as the default of Firefox search and Yahoo
was the second choice but
what we knew about default
is like, people don't change 'em.
And so, Yahoo and Google
were locked in a battle
for who was gonna win search.
Google was getting traction
but Firefox accelerated
Google's traction and that
was making a real difference.
But I remember while
Jerry was yelling at us,
just thinking it's like, man,
if we can get a guy like Jerry
like, very successful, so angry,
we're probably doing
something interesting.
And so it's like while he's
yelling at us, I was like, well,
I probably should stop
screwing around and just join
and that's when I decided to join.
And that's a totally true story.
And so at the same time I
joined, Reid joined the board
and then we recruited a guy named Joey Edo
who runs the media lab at MIT
now, to join the board as well
and we were off to the races.
So small organization, we started growing.
So 2005, Mozilla had a few percent,
it was a non-profit, nobody
understood what to make of that.
It was open-source for consumers,
which again, was not common
in the slightest in 2005
and suddenly it was a big deal
and people started noticing it.
But people really didn't
understand it much,
but we were spreading because
we had a global community
that we empowered and we
loved and we invested in,
invested in, invested in.
So, here's what it looks
like, Spread Firefox,
this is actually from about 2005.
You can see hey, ha ha, we ran, we won,
like we made no days left.
We have 250,000 dollars, 10,000 names.
You wanna be in Boston Globe?
We're doing a story
about Firefox supporters
and we did this get Firefox
button which showed up
everywhere on the web pretty fast.
This looks so jankey by 2015
standards, but I'll tell you,
the thing about communities
is you want to look important enough
that people should give
a damn about whether
you win or not, but you want
to look fragile enough that
people feel like if they don't
help, you might not succeed.
And so the analogy that
I'll use is in 2008
when the election was
happening, I remember
So I was CEO of Mozilla, I
guess, yeah I was CEO of Mozilla
and I went and did phone
bank calls for Obama.
I called a bunch of people
in western Pennsylvania
that were interesting, no
offense, just they were
interesting to talk to.
But I went because I'm
like, man I really want
that guy to be our president
and he might not win
if I don't go make calls today.
And that's a bizarre
thing to think, right?
But that's the essence of
community and that's the essence
of getting involved because
if I felt like it was stronger
and didn't need me, well I had
plenty of other stuff to do.
(audio muffled)
Yeah, I'll talk about
the community of Mozilla
in a little bit, but it's
everywhere, so they were
open-source contributers,
there were localizers
in the different languages,
there were people who were
installers and doing customer
support, it was everywhere,
it really felt much like a
political movement, so everything
you can think of was really community.
And this was still an
organization that probably had 15
people on the payroll.
So here are some critical
decisions that we made.
And this is the crux of it.
So we decided I was
employing over 15 or so
and Mitchell and I decided that hiring
and getting great talent was key.
So what that means is we had
to figure out how to pay people
which we had a pretty good
relationship with Google,
so that was working.
And we decided to pay people
pretty well, but we never
wanted to win on salary.
And so that's explicit because
we were happy to lose people
who wanted more salary.
So if we had a conversation
where people said, man,
So in 2005 it was like us
and Facebook was growing
and Google was growing and
if people came in and said,
gosh, I'd really like to work
for you, but Google's offering
me 10,000 dollars more a
year, the answer was always
go to Google.
And we didn't care, it was fine.
So this is a different
environment, so 2015,
I think the guidance you'll get mostly,
is you shouldn't lose
people over 10,000 dollars.
So it's not apples to apples advice.
For us, what it was, was our
North Star about whether people
wanted to be there or not.
And so if you wanted to be there for comp,
then we didn't want them.
If you wanted to be there
because of the mission,
around opening the web,
and they were willing to be
you know, comped well, but not perfectly,
we were happy to have them.
So that was part of it, the second thing
Oh, and as a result, we
brought on some people
who are unbelievable, you
know, the first person
I went out and got is a
guy named Mike Schroepfer
who's the CTO of Facebook now.
Dan Portillo who runs talent
for us in Mozilla was our first
recruiter, Bret Reckard
who runs talent at Sequoia
was our second recruiter.
It's just such a list, like
once you decide to go get talent
and you decide to go
get people who are wired
a little funny and want
mission over just comp,
life got better.
(audio muffled)
Yeah, so the question is
whether I would advise people
to do that today.
I think that you should
figure out what you care about
and what your North Star
is on people and hiring
and figure out what that
test is and be true to it.
There's start-ups that I'm
involved with that we (chuckles)
We pay way higher than I would
really be comfortable with.
On the other hand, I
would be less comfortable
if we lost the people
they were tryin' to hire.
There's a search company that
I'm involved with for example,
where we just pay over the top
because that's how you
get great search people.
And so I think it's horses
for courses I'll say a lot
which is or different
strokes for different folks,
whatever you wanna say, but
I think every start-up's
a little bit different and
the question is like which
are your North Stars and
it's good to write them down,
it's good to understand.
Everybody understood this.
So I never got a hiring
manager or Peter saying
should we go over the
top on Facebook's offer?
Should we go over the
top on Google? Never.
Other questions?
Okay, the second thing is
that we decided we were not
gonna all be in local.
And this was self-defense,
it was also sort of true
to our DNA.
In an open-source project,
in the best ones you have
people all around the
world who are contributing
and we decided that
rather than try to compete
with other people in
Silicone Valley for talent
with Google and Yahoo,
and Yahoo and Zynga and
Microsoft and everybody else,
we would just find the best
people who were already contributing
we'd hire them and we'd
try to hire their friends.
As a result, we had an office in
There was something in New
Zealand for example, in Auckland
who was one of our best
contributers and he's like,
well, I think I'm contributing now a lot
but I think I'm gonna
have to ratchet it down
so I can get this job and
we were like, well, Robert,
Rob, why don't you just come work for us?
And he said well, I don't
really wanna work on my own.
And we're like, Rob,
why don't we just start,
like, do you have any friends?
And he's like, I've got a ton of friends
and they're all PhD's in computer science
and we're like, Rob, why
don't we start an office?
And so as a result we have
this office in New Zealand
in Auckland and we have
an office in Berlin,
an office in Paris, an office
in London, and one in Tokyo
and our point of view was we were gonna
Our hiring strategies we were
gonna find the best people
who were motivated not by
money but by the community
and by the mission.
We were gonna figure out
where they were in the world
and how they wanted to live their lives
and we were just gonna live that way.
And so as a result we got
this big, distributed company
it wasn't a philosophy that I
loved distributed companies,
I don't, I mean there are
other people who really do,
like Matt Mullenweg from
Automatic really loves
distributed companies.
I don't love them, I think they're
a humongous pain in the ass.
For us, it was how to take our challenge
and turn it into an advantage.
We ended up with a lotta
people in a lotta places,
I learned a lot about employment
law which is super boring.
And then always treat
community as insiders
so you know, we lots a times
we would let people speak
to the press on behalf of us
who didn't work for Mozilla.
They gave out business
cards, a lotta this stuff
and it's because we were
trying to get as many people
owning the product,
owning success as possible
'cause again, we needed
it to be asymmetrically
with Microsoft so the question
was how do we compete?
How do we get assets in
a way that they can't do?
And the funny thing is they
just didn't even recognize it.
Like for us, when Microsoft
is this big software company
and they see this weird
like political movement
full of people in Poland and Germany
and they're like, what the hell is that?
And it just didn't look
at all what they thought
a challenge would look like
which meant that they didn't
really pay attention until too late.
But mostly like the community
is what built Mozilla
in the first place.
It's why Mitchell and
Brenden committed to being
a non-profit because they
wanted to say to the community
we'll never take advantage
of you, we'll always put
our money back in.
Sure.
Yeah.
Wow, what makes you think
it didn't get chaotic?
So I've got a different
presentation wrote.
The community was so
diverse, how did you keep it
from getting chaotic?
And I'll tell you, it was
motherfucking chaotic.
There's no way to put this like gently.
To most humans that have
ever worked in companies,
walking into Mozilla they're like,
what the hell is happening?
Because so many people are going
in so many different
directions and we can talk
about that for hours and hours and hours,
but again, what you do is
you figure out what's the DNA
of the place and what's our
superpower and you figure out
how to feed that.
And language turned out was okay,
like everybody had to speak English,
everybody was living on Bugzilla
which is Mozilla's not
amazing bug tracking system.
But it was one of the first of it's kind.
And then we just, we had
a lotta beers together
and we flew people in
to the same place a lot.
One of the things over time
is that I had a travel policy
which was any time anybody
wanted to get a group together,
they could and whatever
city they wanted to do it.
And you could do it in
Toronto or Australia
or Sydney or Tokyo or
wherever and my promise
is that I would yell if people
were spending too much money
and I just never, they
never spent too much money
otherwise very responsible.
But I said, look, if you need
to spend time with your group,
do it, don't ask anybody, just do it.
And so we just did a lot like that.
Yeah, this a theme,
ignore everything else.
Like, every six months people said to me,
man, Boeing would totally
adopt Firefox if we just built
these horrible features into it.
And then six months later,
it would be Fidelity
it would be the same and It'd be amazing.
And our center of gravity was
we needed to build software
that humans give a damn
about, and if we do that,
the rest of it will take care of itself.
And the enterprise will adopt
in spite of us not having
these things.
And that turned out to be true.
It also let me see what
was happening with DropBox
early and that's why I
got involved with DropBox
'cause we were seeing the
same kind of behavior.
And then our mission.
Our mission was not pure
market share, it was
how do you make the
web more participatory?
Okay? Questions? Good.
Alright, so and the pier
we're talking about,
I got there the middle of
2005, when about 15 people.
Move up to the middle of 2008
which is about 150 people
and then, you know, we
got bigger over time
then we got a little fatter.
So, move ahead another
year from 2005 to 2006
market share's a little
more than 10%, we had
about 75 million MAU's
and 25 million DAU's
in a product that is not viral in any way.
There was no app store, there
was no like SendAFriend,
SMSing there was none of that
and so this was all
organic, all political.
The organization had doubled
to an amazing 30 people
and I remember Mitchell
saying, well, when I got in,
Mitchell said, well, glad to have John,
I'm not sure how many
people we really need here.
And then we got to 30 and
he's like maybe we'll get
to 40 people, but I can never
adjust getting to 100 people.
And it's one of those things
where you just see growth
and you see it happening and
you're trying to figure it out
and things just work very,
very, very well on the internet
when they work and you
start to find things.
But here's the key, so
with product market fit,
your issues change, everybody
notices you in a different way
So this is what it looked like now.
So this is better, it's not
great and this I told you Opera
would grasp us and stuff.
So Safari was only on
the Mac and IE was 83%
which still seemed okay to
Microsoft, they hadn't really
put a group that kind of thing.
So with product market
fit, relationships change.
So this is some actual BoD
Deck excerpts from 2006.
So and the board at that time was myself,
and I wasn't the CEO yet, Mitchell Baker,
Brenden Eich, who invented
Javascript, Reid Hoffman
and Ellen Siminoff, who runs
a company called Schmoop now.
And I remember we were
talking and it's like,
well should we get an EA for Mitchell?
Like to help her scale?
Should we get a EA for John?
We're all strapped and
so project managers,
we really needed a VP of
operations maybe somebody,
a lawyer who knew some stuff and like this
is the actual stuff, this
was actually how we started
the board meetings, like, we probably need
some more people, what do you think?
And this is what it feels like
to be in uncharted territory.
We were like, well, what's a good goal?
So we were at 12, 13% now, is 20% good?
Like, I don't know.
And is 20% achievable? I don't know.
Here's what we said six
months ago, let's recheck it
and one of the things that
Allen was talking about
is being iterative.
The reason why you set goals,
is to learn to get better
at setting goals and learn
to get better at leading you.
And so a lot of times,
when you'll set goals,
your first set of goals will be terrible.
It's sort of like when you
go to the gym the first time,
you're trying to exercise
and your muscles don't all fire together.
And so you're trying to teach
yourself in your organization
how to make limits and
live up to them over time.
And so you get better at
setting goals every time, too.
And one of my rules is you never, ever say
in your goal period,
whatever your goal was,
you are black and white about
whether you hit it or not.
If you hit 98% of your
goal, you missed it.
Now, and then you could
interpret it over time
but you had to be very, very
clear about what the goal
was when you started, what
modifications you made
to the goal and whether you hit it or not.
You there, sure.
(audio muffled)
Yeah, so the question
is, how do you explain,
how do you motivate the team?
How do you help them understand goals?
How do you explain to
them what's happening?
And my ideal.
And how to help them feel like
when they miss their goal.
We over time, you get better at this.
For me, it was repetition
and talking and just being
very, very open.
So, we had weeklies every week on Monday
we all had lunch together
and I got up and talked
every Monday for years.
Every quarter we would talk about goals
and what we hit and what we didn't hit.
It turned out, we ended up,
it's funny, and other companies
are like this, too.
If we hit 71% of our goals give
or take that was about right
that was a pretty good quarter.
If we hit 66% of our goals,
it was kinda a shitty quarter.
And so it's a funny, funny zone,
but I've talked to other
people who've said that, too.
Like you want enough
goals that are stretched
that you're trying for more.
I actually didn't like,
I remember our IT group,
they hit 100% of their goals every time,
and I'm like you guys
have to stop doing this.
It means you're not shooting for enough.
So you're not stretching enough.
So for us we just talked it out
a lot, we talked a lot about
I was very open with BoD
decks, I was very open about
what we talked about with
Reid and Ellen about.
And I'd say, here's what we're doing.
And the other thing that
became very clear at the time
was that market share is a
lagging indicator of success,
so on the Internet, market
share can keep going up
even when your fundamentals are not great.
And so the metaphor I use is we're trying
to teach ourself how to look
around corners a little bit
and be predictive of issues
coming down the pike.
Okay?
Right, so we're trying to figure that out
Oh and I was honest about goals.
I'm like, look, nobody's
ever done this before,
there's never been an open-source,
20 person organization
that's attacked Microsoft.
Seems like it's goin' okay,
here's where we could probably
do a little better.
(audio muffled)
No, when you get to this stage,
you're starting to manage
through pretty good
managers and so I was COO,
but I had two or three or
four excellent, excellent VPs
so Mike Schroepfer,
you're never gonna find
a better VP of engineering,
Chris Beard, you're never
gonna find a better VP of marketing
and you know Justin Fitzhugh
who's running IT and OPs.
As a management team, you wanna be good,
as sub-teams you wanna be good
and you wanna be open and transparent
so you start to do a lot of
things in the organization
to encourage people to be
self-aware and aspirational
and honest.
And you know, it helped
that we were winning.
Like we were really trying to do something
nobody had ever done before.
Okay, sure.
(audio muffled)
Why can we monetize an
open-source project?
There was, it was a project called KHTML
which became Webkit that
Apple was investing in.
So we'll talk about that in a second.
The fact that there was
another open-source browser
doesn't really have an impact
on whether we were able
to make money or not.
We got users, we had
tens of millions of users
who used the product, they
searched in the product,
they clicked on ads.
And so if that happens, the
economic engine all runs.
You expected what anybody else does, okay?
Well we're probably
like 30 or 40 now, yeah.
They didn't so, they brought me in.
So Andrew said it's weird
they brought a COO in,
and they didn't, they just
brought me 'cause I was
hangin' around, as I mentioned.
I was hangin' around that I could help.
We just got along and so I came
in with a title it was goofy
I had just come off being a
founder of my own company,
and my title was vice president
of business operations and
no, vice president of business
development operations
which, you know, who
knows what that means?
'Cause it doesn't mean anything.
And so nobody really knew
what to make of that.
i just started showing up,
I think a lot of start-ups
is just showing up and doing
the work that needs to get done
whether it's movin' desks or orderin' food
or makin' business
deals or whatever it is.
So I just started showin' up and we stared
building a company.
(audio muffled)
(laughter)
So did I literally just show
up and sit down at a desk?
Yeah, so I mean, kinda.
I said, hey Mitchell,
is it okay if I come by?
It was okay, sure.
Mission in hiring? Why I went there?
'Cause the web sucked.
The web sucked in 2004 and
they were gonna fix it.
All my developer friends
started using Firefox
that's about when something called
the predecessor for
that's when HTML mail came out,
so right before G-mail there was only--
- [Male student] Hotpost.
- Hotpost. Hotpost came
out by Ethan Diamond.
Stanford guy, I think.
And you could see it, you
could see that the web was dead
and dying and this feels
ridiculous to everybody
but it was just dead.
IE was really terrible.
And my ideas, I couldn't
stop thinking about it.
And so I couldn't stop
thinking about the web
and the impact and my
skills kinda mashed with
what the holes in the
organization were at the time
and so I went.
Some more interesting
stuff, so let's go forward.
So 13% market share, give or take,
varies a bunch, but world-wide.
About 25 million users, we
weren't sure whether growth
has slowed or not and like
part of the thing is we didn't
have any data systems that were working
and so one of the first things
we did is we hired a guy
named Ken Kovach who worked
for the Freakonomics guy
and we started building data
systems so we could tell
what the hell was going on.
It turns out it hadn't slowed,
but we didn't know that.
So we put it in the BoD
Deck, we were just tryin'
to figure it out.
And then it was clear that Firefox 1.0
that had been out 18 months
before was diminishing IE7
and Safari on Windows was kinda going ooh
which that was a big deal!
Apple releasing a browser on
Windows seemed like a big deal.
And then maybe iTunes.
Like I mentioned about not
knowing your competitors,
it's really hard to see so this
is actual BoD stuff, right?
And they were trying to figure out
where do we find more users?
And so what happens is you get bigger,
your numbers get bigger and
bigger, you try to figure out
where the hell can we find more users?
And like it becomes less
interest and like once you have
100 million users, it's like,
oh, i can only get a
million users that way?
That doesn't seem very interesting.
And this becomes an
innovators dilemma problem.
But the real thing is
that I wanna talk about
is that when you find product market fit,
people who were previously
clearly your friends
you become frenemies kinda sorta
and so it becomes more complicated.
To use Facebook terminology.
So for us, Google was
starting to think about this,
as we were starting to gain market share
and Google was a huge
ally, Sergey and Larry
made Firefox possible economically.
Eric was very supportive.
But they were tryin' to think
What they were realizing
in 2005 is that the browser
dis-intermediated them
between their customer.
The browser was in the
way and whoever controlled
the last touch point to a user, wins.
So they were nervous about this.
And so they felt like it was
critical to their destiny
but critical but not in their
own hands, they didn't like
that we were kind of independent
and didn't really care
what they thought.
It was a challenging
part of the relationship.
And they were not sure
what was gonna happen
when IE7 came out.
We knew Webkit/Safari
on Windows was coming,
we were wondering what was happening
and for them, anything more
than IE and one other browser
that was gonna fracture the market.
So they started thinking
about it more and more.
So they started doing scenario planning
and we were kinda piecing this together.
But for them, like if IE
has 80% and Firefox has 20%,
well that's okay, but not great.
If Apple has 20%, that
seems bad for Google,
even in 2005.
If it's a split, then the web dies again
because there's too much spread.
And then they were hoping
that we would start to use
something called Webkit
which was Apple's version
of open-source technology
and we were using, I think,
called Gecko rendering engine.
And so it just got complicated.
So this is worrisome and
we more or less decided
to stay the course and not
So we decided to keep our
own technology, not move
to the flavor of the
day because our mission
was to have a diverse heterogeneous web.
We decided to invest in more
and more and more liquizations
and I mean we decided, we
need to not be pigeon-holed
as just a product, we need
to keep being a movement
and keep being a community.
So those were like the
three clear, crisp decisions
that came outta that.
And that manifested itself this way.
What happens is you get
bigger and your organizational
complexity goes way up
and so I remember we had
this meeting in 2007 and I
said, look, two years ago,
we were 15 people, we
got 15 million users,
we had some money, we were
workin' on Firefox 1, you know?
And then look at us now
and like big ore charts,
and ore charts are awful
and mostly necessary
but we just started
getting really complicated
and hard to figure out.
So this was the preface
for the reorg that I did.
But then I said, look oh here's
where we were two years ago
and here's where we are now.
And just to give people a
sense of why it was feeling
so dislocating and why
people were feeling alienated
and why people were feeling
a little bit disconnected
from mission.
And so a lot of what the
job of the chief is during
this growth period is to
help people feel connected
to the company and connected to mission.
And so this is another way we think about
as many people as work, we
talk about one developer
Somebody asked about the
community and where the community
came from.
One developer, maybe 90
people on the whole team,
you know we had hundreds
of people contributing
the source code, the open source code.
This is before we had a
thousand contributers,
we had 10,000 people who
are downloading the offer
every night.
And this was also new, like
most people weren't shipping
software so literally we
would have interns come in,
they would write code,
it would get checked in,
and like 10,000 people would
be using it the next day.
Which is a little terrifying.
When I'm coding, but everything
had millions and millions
and millions of monthly users.
So that's how we thought about
it and then, like I said,
things that seem big,
aren't and I wrote this
blog post, Steve gave
a Keynote, what i said.
This is the state of
browsing now, this seems like
this is bad so we're gonna
make it more like that.
(laughter)
By launching Safari on Windows.
And I'm like, whoa!
This is before everybody
watched Keynotes, Steve notes,
but like I was watching it
and did he just say that?
And this is my favorite,
one of my favorite things.
Anyway, so I used to work at Apple,
I love Apple, I buy many
of all their things,
but they've never been
very good at the web
and they certainly were
not good at the web
or understanding the web
then and they thought Firefox
was kinda like dirty,
weird, commie, goofy thing.
I'm not kidding.
And so I wrote a thing
about them and Firefox
and it got me on Facey
Jobs, just very exciting.
Anyway, this turned out to
be wrong, 'cause who wants
Safari on Windows?
And so we launched
Firefox 3 and what we did
is we went back to our roots
and we said, we're gonna do a
Guinness record for the most
downloads in a 24 hour period.
But the pitch was be part of the movement.
Come in and be part of
it, this is you, again,
we went back to how do
you see yourself in this?
How do you get your friends to do it?
And so we had people
sign up it said I pledge
to download Firefox,
there's Shrep, right there.
And then we had Firefox
counters, this was like the first
three or four days where
we got 20 million downloads
which is a big number then.
And then this is the map which
actually got us in trouble
because there are countries
like Iran and Syria on there,
like you can see Iran is huge downloader
which turned out to
maybe have been illegal
so we talked to the
government for a little while
about it.
Anyway, so and then this is the key.
So we launched in 70 languages for IE7.
IE7 launched in five.
Microsoft, giant corporation,
launched in five,
we launched in 70 because we had a huge,
activated volunteer
community that wanted to.
We launched in Mongolian day of.
And so this is what happened,
the piece of the web
was so much bigger in the
2000's than it had been
in the 90's that IE came and dominated it
and Firefox was so much bigger.
Like we all thought of
Netscape as like this founding,
like shot from heaven
and this amazing start
but Mozilla, Firefox
had so many more users
by the time we got to scale,
than Netscape ever had,
and that's mostly because
the market got bigger.
So like don't take it the wrong way.
We'll see if Mark keeps re-Tweeting
Chris's court notes after this.
But then the gray is the rise of Chrome.
So it worked and we
doubled down on community
and many, many ways community
is what sustained us.
And so the last thing I'll say about this
is there were some things on the horizon.
So in 2008, we're 150 people,
I had just been named the CEO
give or take, and so the
things we knew were coming,
we knew Chrome was coming,
we knew that Google had
it decided in the interim
that they had to take control
of their own fate.
And to their credit, they did
it in a very transparent way
with us and a very collaborative way.
So there were no surprises.
It's a little scary to compete
with Google, but it was
a good, collaborative thing.
And then Farmville, I swear
to God, and I told Mark Pinkus
this the other day.
In Firefox we made one mistake
on our technology investment
which was we had an
extension mechanism would
If you run an extension, it
could do anything under the code
in Firefox which meant that a
lotta people wrote extensions
that were bad and would cause
Firefox to eat a lotta memory
it would leak memory.
And we couldn't test them
because we didn't have them.
And so in our tests,
Firefox was performing well
and not leaking memory, but
in many, many, many user
environments it was performing badly.
And so we had this problem,
it was a user problem
that we couldn't see and
a lot of it was flash.
And then flash's interactions
with extensions really
screwed us up and Farmville went from zero
to 70 million users in a year.
It was a Zynga game that
Mark made and it really,
highlighted what a crashy
browser Firefox was.
And so this cultural movement
that went up like this
really shot Firefox and it
really caused us issues.
But that was still on the
horizon, but mostly mobile
and mobile is the real
exostensial issue that Mozilla
is struggling with, even today.
So that's what I said about
Mozilla and then we've got
about 15, 10, 15 minutes
more with Allen's stuff.
Any questions about Mozilla
before we move over?
Why is mobile not
working for Mozilla? Now?
I don't wanna talk too much
about it what I would say
is that things happen, black swans happen
because of particular context,
particular points in time
and Microsoft neglect and
the PC platform being open,
enabled this thing to
happen that Mozilla was just
very, very, very well poised to jump into
and then they caught hold of
the tiger's tail a little bit
and then they used everything they could
to get people like me and
Shrep and other people in
and like start building
this movement and so,
I don't know, I feel very
fortunate that they had been
wandering around for years and years
to build this foundation that
we could do something with.
So anyway, sure.
(audio muffled)
Yeah, the question is,
looking back it's easy
to connect the dots, looking
at the time we're at most
surprising things.
I think you saw 'em in the
slides, like we didn't know
whether we were winning
or not, we didn't know
how to make sure that people
ran projects and the wheels
always felt like they
were coming off the place.
And so I don't know what
the surprising things were.
I think the surprising things
were just that I could step
off the plane anywhere in the world
and there would be people
who wanted to come talk to me
Like the first time I went to Tokyo,
this contributer rode the
train six hours each way
just to have dinner with me
and the dude didn't speak
English, right? (laughter)
He really, really cared
and a lotta Mozilla,
a lot of his identity was
tied up in Mozilla and Firefox
and freedom of expression
and changing the world
and there are not a
lotta things like that.
And so, yeah, I don't know.
That was always surprising
and I feel very humble
even now thinking about that.
- [Male student] How much do
you think being a non-profit
pointed you towards success
as opposed to you (audio muffled)
- I don't know.
So the question is: how do
you feel about non-profits?
Like maybe it's 'cause you're successful
'cause you're a non-profit
and I have a really hard time
with this question because
Mitchell and Chris and I
are one of the only groups
in the world ever to get
450 million users of anything.
And people say, oh, sure,
but you're a non-profit,
of course you did that.
And so I have a hard time
answering this question
because it sure didn't
help, like unbalanced
like it would've been
easier to be a company.
But we only could've done done
what we did the way we did it
so I don't know how to
answer that question
other than there were
good days and bad days.
Okay, you ready?
- [Allen] Yeah.
- [John] Good.
- So what was Mozilla's, I mean
not a total focus on growth
but still they grew really effectively.
So we were talking earlier about scaling.
So what is Mozilla's hypothesis?
What's their growth hypothesis?
So it was a really good browser.
- Nothing scales on its own.
- But nothing scales on its own, so.
Sorry?
The community, so
basically there's this bat
and you jump in here and correct
me if I'm takin' this wrong
but there's a bat basically,
that the community
will actually be a primary carrier?
- If we built great things
for communities to spread it,
that they would spread it because
it made their lives better
because basically it's spread
by customer support people
so you said I'm supporting
my mom and my dad,
I want them both on
Firefox, I can support them,
I can't support IE.
It's that played out a hundred times.
- Right, so then basically
we've got a kind of built-in
word of mouth thing so this is
what we're trying to achieve
but talking a little bit about
growth through value here.
So we were talking about
this a little bit earlier
about how you grow effectively
if in fact your idea
is you wanna make sure the people feel
like they're supporting each
other and bring each other
onto the platform in
order to provide security,
in order to provide the
ability to do tech support,
in order to support something
that they actually care about.
Those are reasons we're able
to come pick up the thing
and use it.
Obviously you guys didn't do
virality, you specifically
called that out as
something you didn't do,
but obviously during
this time we had products
which were already
growing in the viral thing
where basically the product
itself was spreading itself.
So just really briefly on
this, unfortunately because
we're short on time, I
wanna make sure we cover
some of the specific lessons
we can take away from Mozilla.
If you've got that product
market fit we talked about
this earlier, if you've
got a product market fit,
you may not have it with
all the users you actually
care about.
The question is can you leverage users
where you have the product market fit?
In order to be able to drive stuff.
So one possibility is if
you've got a strong community,
who cares a lot about it,
can they do their spreading for you?
This, to the point of
Linkedin's initial audiences,
was exactly the thing that we discovered.
We basically discovered
there's a set of people
who really, really, really,
really, really, really cared
about networking.
They loved to meet new people,
they loved to add connections
and so forth and they were primary drivers
of our early growth.
They were a place where
we had product market fit
literally from day one.
So sometimes you gotta
figure out a way to leverage
that particular group of audiences.
If you've got a place where
you've got a bunch of people
who did not find it valuable
or just find it a nice product,
they're not gonna grow
your product for you.
Okay, so the question is:
how do you take advantage
of people who find they
want it or they need it?
A lotta people wanted Mozilla,
they wanted that browser.
A lotta people like
recruiters needed Linkedin.
Those people, can they be your drivers?
And these are your options
basically you can improve
a product fit for your nice
groups, this is Linkedins
primary resource for growing stuff
because we had a lotta people
found Linkedin nice and we
became probably best in the world
at driving viral growth because we had to.
Because we wanted to
optimize the experience
for these folks.
We wanted somebody who just found Linkedin
and nice to have, we wanted
to make sure we converted
that into as much growth as possible.
But if you can take full advantage
of those want/need groups
or you can basically
optimize your nice growth
you can do a lot.
You guys also used a bunch
of different mechanisms
for getting out.
You mentioned PR, so PR is
actually a fantastic opportunity
to grow, to build awareness.
Taking out a newspaper ad is about as
direct of growth and awareness approach
as you can possibly take.
Incentives, now we have
Facebook, Linkedin,
other mechanisms which by you
can actually spread something.
There's a little bit of a
different story on the enterprise,
and hopefully we'll get an
opportunity to talk to folks
about this as we go along.
The enterprise is a different value,
you're actually not trying to grow broadly
along a large number of people,
what you're trying to do
is you're trying to grow
among decision-makers.
So things you need to do
there, are quite different
I listed out some of them here, primarily
around Beta customers.
And around building awareness
basically through the things
that Beta customers
actually pay attention to.
So let me give you an example,
At Linkedin we have a recruiter product,
it's actually represents
a very large component
of Linkedin's revenue.
How do you get to the place
where people are actually
adopting that at scale?
Well the growth hypothesis
here is pretty straightforward,
it's basically try it out, if
you find real value from it
then basically somebody
within the company will try
to buy essentially for their entire group.
But you gotta get in front
of that set of people.
The first set of customers
who actually see it
you have to be able to get
to those people in some way.
So the growth hypothesis
is basically run a beta,
then use those Beta as light,
what we call lighthouse customers,
people who will basically go out and speak
on your behalf by how valuable
the thing actually is.
And then take advantage
of these places where
decision makers are currently looking.
Marketer, your gardener, all that stuff.
And consumer bottoms-up
we can talk about that
at some point.
Resourcing.
So what did Mozilla have to
do in terms of resourcing
their growth?
John talked about it quite a bit.
About adding Shrep and a few other folks
and what were the other kind of components
of actually making Mozilla successful?
In terms of adding the
people you actually need?
Talk about that in a second.
Yeah.
- [Male student] They're very distributed.
- So very distributed, so the
idea is you can get lots of
because you go where
the talent actually is.
What else?
So go ahead.
They were mission oriented
so they attracted the right
kind of people but they also
found themselves go ahead.
- [John] You guys talk about
us being vague, so we had a
very, very specific kind of metrics
and one was: are we
for each marginal hire,
do we get more community leverage
or less community leverage?
So for each hire, is it an internal hire,
or is it in a community-leveraged hire?
Should we get more community
members on the outside
or fewer?
And so we talked about that a lot.
Which is, if we were to hire an admin,
we had to understand
where we were gonna make
that up in community.
And so as a result, a lotta
jobs are about community
even admins.
- Yep, and I think it's a
great point, so if you break
your hiring and your resource
down into these two groups,
like hiring people who
can directly drive scaling
then picking people who
would basically be able
to extend the community
and be able to take on more resources
is a key component of doing that.
But you also had to pull in a
few people who were basically
about scaling people internally.
Which is basically about
protecting that group of people.
I'm not gonna go through
the rest of these things
just in time 'cause we do
want talk about next week.
- [John] We'll share the other slides,
wanna show what the headlines are?
- Yeah, so development
technology learning systems.
And then just basically
a pattern of recruiting.
OS2 is basically very first
time when you actually have
to put recruiting functions in place
because you need to be able
to build outside your network.
- Yeah, a lotta this stuff comes from
is related to the book that
Reid and Chris are writing
and so which we'll share
out in the DropBox.
So we'll share out a draft of that.
Please keep it to yourselves,
don't spread it around.
It's very, very early copy
but you'll get a sense
of this framework from the book.
- [Allen] Alright, so what's next?
- So the next two weeks,
we're talking about OS2.
So on Thursday, a very
special person's coming
named Jennifer Pahlka who
started to thing about
code for America and you'll see a bunch of
It's another non-profit,
it's the only non-profit
of the course other than Mozilla.
I'm on her board, Tim
O'Reilly's on her board
I'm leaving to have dinner
with them right now.
And it's about how you start movements
and how you get projection of outcomes
that's bigger than just the people inside.
So they're about maybe
60 or 70 people now,
she's going through this phase.
And after that Mariam Naficy from Minted,
which is much, much bigger
than you would think,
And then Hashim Marocha who's
working on a new project
that is super secret, we'll
see what he says about it.
And then he formerly ran
part of the You Tube.
I think he will probably
talk mostly about people
and recruiting and how
you build a really robust
culture.
Oh, I had a slide about
That's what Jen looks like, yeah.
She was also Deputy CTO for
the White House recently
so she's a killer.
So three minutes left,
any questions or comments?
(audio muffled)
- So the question is like after
we got to the early adopters
how did Linkedin continue to grow?
So the idea is that because
viral spread is built in
to Linkedin, basically everybody who comes
in who wants to find value
of it ends up bringing
additional folks in.
A lot of those people are well outside
the early adopting class,
so for the longest time,
we basically had
At the very beginning we
had people join in cold
and then inviting their networks
then we had everybody inviting each other.
And then as we actually
distributed our value more,
now we have more cold
people coming and joining
'cause they're coming for
a very specific value.
So in the early days,
it was I want a network,
then it was, oh this is pretty
cool, I can use it to recruit
awesome, I wanna do that
or I wanna get a job.
Then the third part was
I'm beginning to find this
on Google, I'm beginning to
hear about it in the press,
I'm actually getting a job
through it, so I'm gonna sign up
cold to do it.
(audio muffled)
The only part we plan
on from the beginning
was the viral spread which
came from that early group.
The part we didn't plan on was the amazing
product market fit with
that set of early adopters.
Which was a surprise, a good one, too
and a necessary one.
Yeah.
So what'd we see from the nice users?
So we had a very specific
theory around the nice users.
Which is that even if they were
joining and inviting today,
actually being a Linkedin
user was a low-impact sport.
Basically what you would
do is you'd be on Linkedin
you'd use it very, very
regularly, you would respond
to things when people came to you.
So basically, there was
very little risk in being
part of Linkedin but
then the value started
coming to you down the line
and every time you received
value from the system,
you woke up and became
part of the active network.
- Plus the e-mails.
- Thus the e-mails.
(laughter)
- Alright, we should finish up.
- Yeah, we should finish up.
I'll be around for a few minutes
to answer further questions
- Alright thanks for class,
we'll see ya Thursday.
