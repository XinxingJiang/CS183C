- So first off just I'll
introduce myself a little bit,
so I'm Shishir Mehrotra.
My background, I went to
school out east at MIT.
Don't hold that against me here.
I left school to start a
company called Centrada.
That was back in the 2000s cycle.
I then spent a few years at Microsoft,
worked on Office, then
Windows, then SQL Server.
Then spent six years at Google,
mostly working at YouTube,
that's mostly what we'll talk about today,
and I left Google about a year
ago to start a new company.
And I don't actually plan to
state much about that today.
So, let me tell you a little bit
about what I'm going to talk about.
So, over the course of
six years at YouTube,
we learned a lot of different things.
What I did, was I tried
to pick out some lessons
from that period.
And just to give you context,
I joined YouTube 2008,
and people may forget
but YouTube was in a very
different state at that time.
YouTube had just been purchased by Google,
a little over 100 people.
At the time, actually
not seen as a success,
it was seen as a great exit,
but seen as a company that may still fail.
There was a lot of people who thought that
Google made a big mistake
in the acquisition.
And six years later, it
looks very different.
We'll talk about some of
how those changes happened.
Let's see, I wrote down a couple notes
of preamble before we get started.
Let's see, so, oh, my role at YouTube.
So, my role was a little
bit non-traditional,
so I thought I would explain
a little bit how that worked.
So officially I was responsible
for product engineering
and user experience.
We actually ran YouTube as a triumvirate,
so a guy named Salar Kamangar
was what you would call the chairman CEO,
and then day to day operations were run by
myself and a guy named Robert Kinsel.
So Robert generally
handled the business side,
so he handled sales, marketing,
content partnership, and so on,
and I handled the product site,
and the three of us did
a lot of stuff together,
so these stories are mainly
coming out of those experiences.
One other caveat is,
I have no made attempt
to be comprehensive.
I think there's lots of things
that matter as you scale,
I have prioritized counter
intuitive and interesting.
In fact, the way we put the talk together,
was last night I sat down with a friend,
with 20, 25 stories, and he
stack ranked them for me.
So, you're going to see the
ten that are interesting.
They may seem somewhat
random in different order,
but hopefully stuff that
is counter intuitive.
And then goals, so I
have two goals for today.
I imagine this room has,
Reed was telling me,
has a wide group of people,
at various different
points in their career.
The way I think about this is,
as you hit those moments of scaling,
my goal is to take some of these stories
and A, help you recognize when you
see one of those patterns, and B,
give you a set of tools and
lessons to apply at those times.
So, I'll try and do that
throughout the talk.
And, I think that's it, let's get started.
So, these are the ten we're
going to talk through.
I said it, they're not
sort of well structured,
but I did find a natural grouping.
So, the first two I called choose wisely.
The general theme there is,
I don't know how many people
here are poker players,
but every poker player will tell you,
learning how to play poker is partially
about learning how to play the game,
but mostly about learning to pick
which table to sit down on.
So, I'll talk a little bit about
how you pick which table to sit down on.
Charting the course, I think of as,
the core of running a business.
How do you make hard choices,
how do you think about ecosystems,
values, so on.
And then, the last three I'll focus on
some team related things.
How do you pick people,
how do you organize them,
what's your own role in those situations,
and so on.
That's going to be the ten.
Good, alright, let's start.
So, tailwinds.
So, let's start with tailwinds.
The story I want to
tell here is a bit about
the YouTube tailwinds.
And really the main
point I want to talk about here is,
how to pick businesses
that have great tailwinds.
So, let's start by looking at what,
how we used to describe
the YouTube tailwinds.
So, this is how we
described it for YouTube.
So, back in 1988 the number one show
on TV was the Cosby Show.
The Cosby Show got a 25 point rating,
had about a 50 percent household share.
For people not familiar
with media metrics,
what that means is, if your TV was on
on a Thursday night at 8 o'clock,
there was a better than average chance
you were watching the Cosby Show.
You fastforward ten years,
the number one show on TV was Seinfeld.
Very similar ratings, very
similar household share,
but if you go 10 years past that,
you get to 2008 and you see
American Idol with a 12 point share.
Now, one interesting side
note in this story is
Seinfeld in its first few episodes
actually didn't do that well,
its pilot and a few episodes after that.
And so Seinfeld was almost cancelled
by the NBC executives,
and if you go back and look at its ratings
during that period, Seinfeld actually had
better ratings than
American Idol had in 2008,
so the new normal was set in
a very short period of time.
So, one obvious question
is, what happened?
Where did all those people go?
Did they stop watching television?
The answer to that is no,
actually through that whole period,
the number of hours a day the average
American family spent watching television
actually went up every single year.
What seems to have happened
is this bottom line, the
choice all of a sudden changed.
And this chart is just
looking at cable networks,
this is about in that
time frame, 2008, 2009,
and this is just plotting cable networks
on one axis and audience
share on the other.
And just shows that about 50 percent,
if you take all the networks
that had less than 1 percent share,
they accounted for about
50 percent of viewership,
and ones that had less
than half a point share,
counted for 30 percent of viewership.
Half a point is an important mark,
because it's actually where
Neilsen stops measuring.
And this was, this about
the amount of viewership
that's sort of unaccounted
for, on television.
So, how does this apply to YouTube?
So the YouTube thesis mapped
directly to this narrative,
and the way we would talk about it is,
if you looked back over
the history of television,
there was a long period of time
where we had three major networks.
Fox got added in later.
And then over a short period of time
that turned into hundreds
of cable channels,
and the YouTube tailwind
was this trend we saw,
that we thought, or think,
that the same transition was about
to happen in the online video world.
Or to say it differently,
we believe online video's
going to do to cable
what cable did to broadcast television.
We are going to go from tens of channels,
or ones of channels, to tens of channels,
to thousands or millions of channels.
Okay, so why does this matter here?
One of the things I've been
able to do across my career
is work on lots of
different types of products.
Some that have great tailwinds,
some that have great headwinds.
And if I had to give one clear lesson,
it's work on ones that
have great tailwinds.
And there's a few reasons why.
One is that it accelerates
everything you do.
You can do little things
and they become amplified.
But probably the biggest reason I'd say
is it covers a lot of mistakes,
and in the period of building something,
you're inevitably going to make mistakes.
I think picking things
that have those tailwinds
makes it much easier to
weather through them.
So, that's for lesson number one.
When you're picking which table to set up,
pick ones that have tailwinds.
Alright, number two.
Let's talk about purpose.
So, Daniel Pink wrote this book.
Anybody read this book?
So, it looks like a few.
It's called Drive.
It's about what motivates people.
The book's pretty good,
if you aren't that
interested in reading it,
go watch, there's a YouTube video of it.
And if you're even less interested,
I can summarize for you quickly now.
So the book is basically,
his theory is what motives
people is three things,
mastery, autonomy, and purpose.
Mastery is being good at what you do.
Autonomy is having the room and space
to be able to do it well,
and purpose is feeling a connection,
feeling a connection
between that and impact.
And he tells a lot of great stories
about how to look at each
of those different things,
and how it impacts motivation and so on.
Over the years, I've come
to the conclusion that
of those three, the one that
matters the most is purpose.
So, I want to tell you
a little bit about how
I thought about purpose at YouTube.
And the story I want to
tell is about this fellow.
Who knows who this guy is?
Okay, everybody knows.
So that's Sal Kahn.
This guy, I assume, less people know.
His name is Imran.
That's Sal's eldest son.
He's actually involved in the story too.
So, let me tell you a little story about
some of the early days at YouTube.
So, Sal and I actually
went to college together,
and stayed in pretty close touch.
We both ended up marrying
our college sweethearts.
Both our wives are physicians.
Moved across the country
about the same time.
We went different paths,
he ended up in the hedge fund industry,
I ended up in the technology industry.
But we would get together regularly,
and in 2008 I had just joined YouTube,
and he and his wife were over for dinner.
And, so conversation started,
and I happened to mention
that I just joined YouTube.
And he said, oh, you know,
I actually use YouTube a lot.
I said, great, that's wonderful.
He said, no, no, no, I use YouTube,
like I upload to YouTube a lot.
And he was trying to
explain what he was doing,
and for people that don't know the story,
he's got this cousin in Louisiana
that he was helping with math homework,
and the easiest way he could find to tutor
her was to have her send questions and
he'd post answers as YouTube videos,
and send them back.
Really, he was using YouTube because
it was an easier way to send a video file.
He said, it's kind of interesting,
I've been doing this,
and a lot of people
seem to be watching it,
and the conversation kind of moved on.
Next day I go to work,
and we had this dashboard
we could use to look up
how channels were doing, and this is 2008,
so this is Stanford, MIT had
both just started uploading
all the footage of all
their classes to YouTube,
and I go and I did some quick math,
and realized that actually Sal was getting
more viewership than
Stanford and MIT combined.
So, I write him a note,
and I say, I don't know
if you realize this but,
you're kicking Stanford and MIT's butt.
You have to get into the
YouTube partner program.
At the time, you couldn't make money
on YouTube without being
in the partner program,
and you had to get invited into that.
So, we invited him into
the partner program,
and he accepted, and started
making money on YouTube.
So, fast forward a few months later,
he and his wife are back over for dinner.
His wife happened to be pregnant,
actually with Imran at the time.
My wife was pregnant with
our younger one at the time,
and again conversation turns to YouTube,
and he says, Shishir,
thanks for setting me up
in the partner program, it's
been a great experience so far.
And then he kind of pulls
me aside a little bit,
and he says, you know,
I've been doing some math,
and looking at the checks coming in,
and I think actually we're
really close to them,
and I can see clearly where
this is going to cross our rent,
and I've been thinking about it,
and I can see a little bit further out
it might cross my hedge fund salary.
I don't really like
working at hedge funds,
so I'm thinking about quitting
and doing this full time.
And he said, what do think I should do?
And this is the moment
where his wife Umaima
gave me the stare of death,
and said, answer this question properly.
And thankfully I told him,
you know, I just bet my career on it,
I would be encouraging
of you doing the same.
To be clear, Sal's
achievements are all his own,
and I think I had this
one little, tiny moment
where I gave him a little extra nudge,
but he did end up quitting,
and the rest of the story,
it sounded like everybody here knows,
and Khan Academy now reaches millions
of people and has tens of
millions of users, and so on.
But the interesting part about that story,
is imagine if this had played
out just a few years earlier.
Imagine if Sal had said,
I have this great idea,
I need to go on to a cable network.
And he had said, hey,
I want to create this
new educational show.
And they would say, great,
do you have any experience as a teacher?
And he said, well, not really,
but I think I'm pretty good at math.
So, okay, okay, do you have any
experience as an entertainer?
And he said, no, not really,
although he is pretty funny.
And they say, okay, well
tell me about the show.
Well, here's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to start at the
beginning of the algebra book,
and I'm going to start solving problems,
and when I get to the end of that book,
I'm going to pick up the next book and
I'm going to do the same thing.
And by the way, I don't want to show
my face in any of the videos,
and I don't want to have any story
lines or plots or anything.
Will you fund my show?
I think he would've gotten laughed out
of just about every
cable network out there.
Thankfully, he didn't
have to pitch anybody.
And this is a theme we used to refer to as
a gatekeeperless world.
And he ended up being able to
start his career on YouTube,
and now he's arguably one of the
biggest educators on the planet.
Now, the reason this matters here.
Fast forward a few years later, to 2010.
I actually was, let's say
not feeling so good at work,
and was debating making a switch.
I was being recruited by another firm,
thinking about leaving YouTube.
I have an advisor, a
guy named Dean Gilbert,
so I called him up and
said, what should I do?
And he asked me to make three lists,
and I think this would be
helpful for you guys as well.
So, list number one, he said,
what are you hoping to
accomplish in the next year?
List number two, he said, okay, take that,
take list number one, and
figure out which of those things
wouldn't happen if you were to leave.
And list number three,
was take list number two,
and say, which of those things would
you feel really terrible about?
Not terrible about the
next day, or the next week,
but months and years later,
which of those would you
feel really terrible about?
And, list number one,
you could say is goals, it's focus, so on.
List number two, I now refer to that
as the marginal utility list.
If you're in an environment where you're
not actually having impact,
If all the same stuff would
happen with or without you,
then you have to question
why you're there.
But list number three actually ended up
being the most important,
and I call that list purpose.
You could also, sometimes
people refer to it
as a tombstone test.
Only work on things that you
want to have on your tombstone.
I think that's a little morbid,
so I like to use the word purpose instead.
But one of my lessons was,
I think, no matter what you work on,
whether it's a small risky start up,
or what seems like a big, stable company,
you'll have moments of lack of confidence,
and you'll see challenges
that may not seem
like ones you can overcome.
And the things that get
you through those periods
are your sense of purpose.
So when you're starting and figuring out
where you want to sit,
I think picking things
where you feel that connection to purpose,
I think is really important.
Alright, that's number two.
Number three.
Let's talk about theses.
So, I'm going to talk a little bit about
how I ended up at YouTube.
First off, I just wanted
to set some context
of what it felt like when I got there.
So, these were some of the headlines
that my mom would send me, as I joined.
Are you sure you're doing the right thing?
And, like I said earlier,
it was far from obvious
that YouTube was going to
be a success at the time.
Now, there's another book I'm assuming
a lot people here have read.
It's one called Zero to One.
It has a bunch of really
interesting ideas.
There's one I really like,
which is this, what important truth
do very few people agree with you on?
I thought that was a really good way
to describe a thesis.
It's one way to talk about
my story of joining YouTube,
it was kind of crazy to
join YouTube at the time.
But once I had a view on it
that not a lot of people agreed with,
it was kind of inevitable.
So, my story actually has to do
with the super bowl of 2008.
I'll come back to that in a second.
So, 2008, I decided I
wanted to leave Microsoft.
I thought I wanted to go start a company,
and so I started coming
down to Silicon Valley,
meeting different people and so on.
And I happened to get called by this guy
Jonathan Rosenberg, who's
an old friend of mine.
Happened to be running product management
at Google at the time.
And he said, you've got to come in
and meet us at Google.
Well, I said, I don't know,
I want to go start a company,
I don't really want to
go be part of a big one.
He said, no, no, no,
just come by and meet us.
I said, alright, I'll come by and so,
went in, and of course if you
think Google was exciting now,
it was incredibly exciting in 2008.
And everybody's pitch
was really out there.
Sergei had his set of
things he was working on,
Eric has his set of
things he's working on.
Vic had just joined and he was
doing a bunch of new things,
and so on, but all of them were
kind of all over the place.
And the last meeting of the day,
I get together with Jonathan again.
He said, what did you think?
I said, I don't know, these
all seem kind of crazy ideas,
but I think I still want
to go do my startup.
He said, no, no, you don't understand.
John's not speaking in this class, is he?
He's actually a really good
speaker for things like this,
but Jonathan says things,
I'd say, directly.
Or another way to put it
is, sometimes crassly.
He said, you're totally missing the point.
He said, Google is, at its heart,
not about Chrome and Android,
and all these other things.
Google's an advertising company,
and all the money and
advertising seems to go
to all these stupid TV ads,
and nobody even watches those TV ads.
And used a bunch of words I didn't use.
So I had never bought or
sold an ad in my life,
I knew nothing about advertising.
So, he said all that,
and it was actually all surprising to me.
I had no idea.
In retrospect, it's kind of obvious,
all the money and advertising
goes to television ads.
It was kind of obvious.
But for me, I didn't know any of that.
So, I get on a plane,
I leave his office and get on a plane,
and I start thinking about what he said.
And this happened to be just a couple
weeks after the super bowl.
I don't if people remember the super bowl,
but it was actually a pretty iconic one,
if any Patriots fans are here, I'm sorry.
I started thinking about the superbowl,
and we tend to throw a
party for every super bowl,
a bunch of our friends would come over,
we'd all watch together.
And I was thinking, he
said that nobody watches
those stupid TV ads,
and yet that one day,
for those three hours,
we watched every single ad.
In fact, I remembered many times,
when people had said,
hey, could you rewind it
so we could see that ad again?
And so I took out a sheet of
paper and I wrote at the top,
what would it take to make television
feel like the super bowl every day?
What's different about that day?
And how could recreate that
experience every single day?
So I wrote down a series of ideas,
went home, went to sleep.
Woke up the next morning,
looked at that set of ideas,
looked at my list of startup ideas,
and said, ah, I don't know
anything about advertising.
Let somebody else do that.
And so I write Jonathan and said,
I don't think Google's for me,
thank you very much for hosting me.
By the way, you mentioned something,
I had a few ideas for you.
Whenever you want, I'm
happy to give them to you.
I'm sure you already thought of them.
Have them call me back.
And I walked him through
some of those ideas,
and he said, you may
think they're obvious,
but they're definitely not obvious here.
We have nobody working
on anything like that,
so if you really want to come do that,
you should come do it.
Through a series of conversations
he convinced me to give up
on starting this company
and through that, I ended
up working on YouTube.
Now, those set of ideas became
something called TrueView.
The basic idea was really simple.
The idea was, you should put
a skip button on all the ads,
that's what the user sees.
That insight by itself,
it's sort of not enough.
The core of it was the idea that the way
to change advertising,
especially video advertising,
was to change the incentives.
And the reason I felt
that the super bowl ads
were so much better than
the rest of the year,
was that the incentives were different.
For a bunch of other reasons
we can talk about later,
if people want to hear about them.
What we want to do is
recreate that experience
all year round.
And so the idea was put
a skip button on ads,
but also don't charge
advertisers if people skip them.
And what that did, was it created a
completely different set of incentives.
Now, YouTube had no
interest in showing an ad
that people wanted to skip,
and the advertisers had to
build better and better ads
if they actually wanted
them to get watched.
It was completely counter intuitive.
Jonathan wasn't underestimating it,
nobody was working on it,
and nobody believed in it,
in fact, they were incredibly
negatively predisposed to it.
I got in front of a sales team
in a room kind of like this,
and they kind of tore me to shreds.
They said, are you crazy?
You're going to put a skip button on ads?
All you're going to do
is erode all the revenue,
while everybody skips their ads.
Thankfully it was the right insight,
and ended up working,
and now TrueView's a
multibillion dollar business,
and the metric we mostly focused on
was revenue per hour,
for an hour of viewership of YouTube,
versus an hour of
viewership of television.
How did it compare?
And by the time I left it was about even
between cable television and YouTube,
which is a pretty amazing
thing to think about,
with the set of skippable ads.
But one of the lessons I learned from that
is sort of back to the statement.
Peter wrote this with a view
towards starting a company.
I think the same statement applies
as you're scaling a company as well.
In that, the most interesting innovations
when you look hard at a problem
and you come out generally
with very simple insights.
Those simple insights will
often take a lot of time,
and TrueView took us almost
three years to get out,
much less to get to scale.
But the core of really making progress
is often finding those insights
and really sticking by them.
So as you think about scaling
and what you're working on,
a lot of the same
principles for how you start
apply as you scale as well.
Alright, number four.
Metrics.
Yeah?
- What were some of
things that Jonathan did
to convince you?
- The question was what did
Jonathan do to convince me?
Do you want to take a
bunch of questions now,
or do you want me to wait?
Okay, it's your class, you can decide.
What are the things
Jonathan did to convince me?
I think mostly he fed my
interest in solving this problem.
Some piece of it was confidence in myself,
and I walked into it saying I don't know
anything about this space,
and he gave me all the examples of all
the people that have been successful
in this space without knowing it,
and why he would rather have someone that
doesn't know it but
has an interesting idea
for it than otherwise,
and the other half of it
was probably confidence and being able
to do it in a big organization.
And so, he ended up handing me a team
of people that were sort of cordoned off.
And then actually turning it
into YouTube happened later.
We started in a slightly different space.
Actually, that project ended up becoming
a thing called Chromecast,
those little dongles that
sit in the back of the TVs.
But he sort of addressed
both those things.
Alright, so let's talk
about metrics a bit.
Now, and why metrics matter.
And so for this story,
it's going to sort of
fast forward time a bit
to the 2011, 2012 period.
Now, I call this the
wandering period for YouTube.
If you think about 2008 to 2010,
we kind of had a fire under our ass.
It was very, very clear
that not only did the world
think we were going to fail,
that Google thought we were going to fail.
It was incredibly motivating
to get through that process,
but now we hit 2011, 2012,
we hit a lot of our goals,
we've now done a bunch of celebrations.
We were well passed the
point of sustainability.
Nobody was talking about
shutting us down anymore.
And all of a sudden, pace slowed.
And it wasn't very clear
how to get it back.
That sort of manifests
itself In a lot of ways.
I think one observation was,
we had no real competitors,
and I've managed to work on businesses
of lots of different types.
Ones in spaces that are
incredibly competitive,
and ones in spaces that are not.
Ones where you're the leader,
ones where you're the follower.
I think everybody thinks
that it's much better
to be the leader and be number one,
or clear number one in a market.
I tell you, there's a lot of
downsides to that as well.
One of the biggest is,
you sort of lose your sense of direction.
You lose your sense of
pace, of motivation.
It's actually incredibly
motivating to be number two,
to a fast-moving number one.
And we were feeling that.
And so, we were discussing
what to do about it.
And two stories came up
that I thought I'd share
before I tell you what we did about it.
So number one,
oh, I'll come back to
that guy in a second.
So, number one was Coca-Cola.
So there's this whole
story about Coca-Cola,
that they were having a strategy meeting
and somebody asked, how long are we going
to keep going back and forth on,
we're 51 percent share versus Pepsi,
and 49 percent or whatever.
Whatever that is, it just doesn't seem
like this is ever going to go anywhere.
And somebody said, maybe
we're looking at it wrong,
maybe we should measure Coke
as percentage of the stomach.
And by that measure, it's a
very small percentage share.
And that led to Coke investing in
all these other businesses,
and now they sell water and lemonade,
and all these other things.
And so that was one kind
of interesting thing
sitting in our head is,
maybe YouTube is the clear number one,
but maybe we're framing the market wrong.
The other one was a story
of this guy, this guy
named Ben Hunt-Davis.
So, he was on the British rowing team,
and in the late 90s
this team got together,
and this is a pretty famous story as well,
you can look him up.
Got together and decided that
they were going to fix things.
So this rowing team, in Britain,
and rowing is pretty popular there,
hadn't won a title in many, many years.
The olympics or any of the
worldwide championships, and so on.
And so they got together
and they made this decision
that they would make every
decision with a single question.
And that question was, will
it make the boat go faster?
And they're going to sit down and say,
should person A or person B
be in the back of the boat?
They would say, well, all that matters is,
will it make the boat go faster?
They'd say, where should we go to dinner?
At this restaurant or that restaurant?
They'd say, well, it doesn't
matter for any reason
other than, will it
make the boat go faster?
They tried to apply this theory,
and it has a happy ending,
they ended up winning.
But these two thoughts, these two stories
really stuck in our heads as we
thought about what to do.
And what we ended up doing has
something to do with a billion,
which is why that guy's up there.
We got together at our
YouTube leadership offsite,
and we announced two things.
So, number one, we announced
a single unifying metric.
We said, from now on, our version of
"will it make the boat go faster"
is going to be watch time.
We're going to make
every decision based on
whether or not it's going
to increase watch time.
I'll come back to why that's
important in a second.
And secondly, we set a goal.
And we said, our goal as a
team is to get to a billion
hours a day of watch time.
We put a time frame on the goal,
but we didn't announce that publicly,
so I won't talk about that here.
We said we're going to get to a billion
hours a day of watch time.
I know that probably is a
hard number to understand,
so I'll give a little bit of context.
At the time we were
doing about a 100 million
hours a day of watch time,
so it's sort of ten X more
than where we were at.
Some of the comparables at the time,
Google was in roughly the same ballpark,
but it's kind of a dumb metric for Google,
because the whole point of Google
is get on and off the
site as fast as possible.
There was no other Google
property even close.
So, we were by far the largest at Google.
In fact, in the rest of the internet,
the only property that had
more than us was Facebook,
and Facebook had about double
that amount of watch time, at the time.
And so we set this goal,
and said these are some
of the comperables.
But the way to think about it is that
television at the time was about
five and a half billion
hours a day of watch time,
so if YouTube was about 100 million,
television's about five and
a half billon hours a day.
And so we said, if we're
successful at this goal,
and getting to a billion
hours a day seemed crazy,
we would still only be
20 percent of television.
So it's sort of our version
of one percent of the stomach.
So a few things about the goals,
first off it was crazy.
My head of data science got up and,
well, before we announced,
and then after we announced,
and told me I was crazy, said
it's never going to happen.
Certainly not in the time
frame I had suggested,
and maybe not ever.
There was, you know,
a bunch of very interesting implications.
You know, for us to hit that goal
it would mean every team doing something
completely differently.
Just to give one example, at the time
YouTube streams a lot of,
obviously streams a lot of video,
uses up a lot of the internet's bandwidth.
At the time, we were
using about 20 percent
of the internet's bandwidth.
It's a little bit hard to
measure internet's bandwidth,
but that was our closest approximation.
In order to hit this
goal based on the pace
that the internet was growing,
the pace that YouTube would have
to grow to hit this goal,
the net impact would be
that we'd be streaming,
at a billion hours a
day, we'd be streaming
roughly double the amount of capacity
of the total internet, at the time.
So, the networking team
had to get to work.
And we kind of went through every team
and described what this goal
would mean for everyone.
Now, so we made these two announcements.
Watch time is going to be
our single clarifying metric,
and we're going to get to a billion
hours a day of watch time.
A couple things happened
out of that announcement.
Number one, it greatly
clarified decision making.
All of a sudden, we
would sit down in reviews
and we'd argue about,
I think you'll see this as
you scale your businesses,
one of the characteristics
of every business these days
is that you have tons and tons of data.
And so you sit down and review,
and you'd say, should we do A or B?
And you say, well, this
is what it does to views,
and this is what it does to revenue,
this is what it does to profit,
this is what it does to content creators,
is what does this content
creator versus that one,
or this group of users versus that one,
and you could argue about it forever.
And what it meant was,
lots of lack of clarity
in decision making.
One good example about it
I like to ask people is,
why do you think YouTube had a reputation
for being a place for short form video?
The restrictions on uploading only
ten minute long videos on YouTube
were long gone at that point,
and yet YouTube still had that reputation.
And the answer was very simple,
we had trained every algorithm
to optimize for views, not watch time.
And so we would get the
creators and they'd say,
oh, I built this great
one hour documentary,
and they cut it up into
five minute sections,
because I wanted 20 views on it, not, uh.
I wanted 12 views on
it instead of just one.
And so we had to retrain ourselves,
we had to retrain the marketplace,
and change how we thought
about those incentives.
The other thing that happened was
it completely changed pace.
And that mission got embedded
in every person in the team.
If you walked around
Google and asked people
what YouTube was working on, they'd say,
oh, they got that billion an
hour thing they're working on.
And you could immediate
recognition from everybody.
And what that meant was,
not only did pace increased,
people started suggesting
bolder initiatives,
and all sorts of innovations
started happening again.
And you get that feeling
that of a start up again,
you get that feeling of
what does it feel like
when you have a goal, when
you have a competitor.
So, the reason I talk about this one is,
I think as you grow you'll
see lots of different metrics.
I think picking a single clarifying
metric is really, really hard.
I'd argue most of the businesses I've been
involved in before or after,
actually I've struggled to do this.
So, I don't mean to imply that it's easy.
But the implications of
having that are great,
both for clarifying decision making
and for helping people understand
the frame of success.
You know, what is the
shape and size of success
that you're aiming for.
Alright, number five.
Let's talk about making decisions.
So, one fun question
I like to ask the team
is what makes a good decision?
You're going to be in these roles,
you're scaling all these businesses,
what is a good decision?
Typical answers I would hear back are
a good decision is one
that's made quickly.
That's probably the most common one.
Another would be, a good decision is one
that's made with all the
right peoples' input.
My view of it is actually
neither of those questions
are a very good one for
whether it's a good decision.
I think there's a single
question for whether
you've made your decisions, and that is,
did that decision stick?
That's what the duct tape is for.
It's the best metaphor
I could come up with.
So, decisions that stick.
So, I wanted to tell a story,
this is from the early
days of my time at YouTube.
So this is in the 2008, 2009 period.
One of the product
managers had a suggestion,
said I think we should link
out to other video websites.
And the typical example
is you come to YouTube,
this is back in that time frame,
you come to YouTube and you
search for Modern Family,
which is a popular show
at the time, still is.
And on YouTube you get a bunch of garbage,
and if you went to Google you'd get links
to watch Modern Family,
on other properties.
You get it on ABC, you get
it on Hulu, wherever else.
And this person's
argument was really simple
and compelling, it says,
hey, we're YouTube,
we're owned by this company called Google.
Our job is to give people answers,
we should give them the
answer they're asking for.
So they come to us and say,
where do I watch Modern Family?
We should tell them,
and we should direct them to those places.
It's a pretty compelling argument.
Of course, we didn't end up doing it,
which I think everybody knows.
Let me explain why.
So, there were a bunch of
business people in the room
who said, oh, if you do that it's going
to confuse our content partnerships
in all these different ways,
and those people were mostly ignored.
That's not how we made
those kinds of decisions.
But then somebody brought
up this different argument.
They said, hey, let's use the analogy of
Amazon and Google product search.
By any sort of logical conclusion
Google product search should
have kicked Amazon's butt.
Google product search is
a full superset of Amazon,
so why would you ever go to
Amazon and look for a product
when you could come to
Google product search
and find everything on Amazon,
and everything everywhere
else on the internet?
It seems like a really sound thesis,
it was completely wrong.
Why is that?
And in fact, you could
apply the same argument
to Google video, and YouTube,
and the fact that Google
had to go purchase YouTube,
when they had a great Google Video
property is telling as well.
Same pattern, Google Video search
indexed all of YouTube,
so it had everything on YouTube,
plus the rest of the internet.
But the net impact was
that the narrower property actually won.
And we came to this conclusion
that in certain markets consistency
beats comprehensiveness.
And you know, in Amazon's
case that's easy to describe.
Why do you go to Amazon instead
of elsewhere on the internet?
Well, you know you get
a consistent experience
for buying a product, you
understand how the reviews work,
you know shipping works,
you know how returns work.
All of those things
actually trump the fact
that they might be missing something.
And basically the same thing
was happening in the video space,
and we believe that was going to continue.
Probably a separate
discussion about whether
this applies to our
market, all markets or not,
but we were quite convinced
that it applied to video.
So, we made the decision,
and we didn't add
external links to YouTube.
Now, the importance of that story is,
of course the decision stuck,
because there's still not
those links on YouTube,
but the real importance of that story
is the implications it
had on future decisions.
So, as an example, the
next thing that happened
was we and at the time we had a bunch of
embedded video players on YouTube.
We went and pulled all of those off.
The next thing after that was,
the team came to us and said,
we'd like to remove an option.
At the time we were giving video uploaders
the option to decide whether videos
were shown on mobile devices or not.
We said, we'd like to remove that option.
If we're willing to sacrifice
the size of our corpus
in order to have a more
consistence experience,
then shouldn't the same principle apply?
We should be willing to
take the percent of people
that don't want their
videos on every device,
and say you can go host somewhere else.
Similarly, we did the
same thing on interface.
At the time, YouTube, the only property
we built for YouTube was
actually the web page.
Every other YouTube experience
was built by that manufacturer.
So, the Xbox team built their experience,
and each of the TV manufacturers
built their experience,
and you know Apple built
their experience, and so on.
The Apple the one is probably the one
that's been talked about the most.
We had to go through a
very tough negotiation
since Apple had been building the YouTube
experience since the very first iPhone.
And pulling it off, that
meant a lot of implications,
including not being default
installed on the iPhone,
which seemed crazy at the time.
But we went and made
that decision as well.
So, we'd rather have a
consistent experience
across all devices, and
we'd sacrifice distribution
in order to do it.
So, the reason I mentioned is,
you'll find yourself in these roles,
and you'll make thousands
of different decisions.
You'll make them all the time.
And it's often hard to figure out,
what are good decisions?
And my main lesson was,
the best decision is not only the one
that gets made quickly and so on,
but rather the one that sticks.
That makes it easier to
make the next 10 decisions,
or in the very best case,
it actually obviates the need
for the next ten decisions,
because everybody already
understands the principle
of what you're trying to get done.
Alright, number six, ecosystems.
Anyone know who this guy is?
Alright, a little hint,
his name is Baauer.
Now, does anybody know who this guy is?
Alright, somebody knew.
So, he's one of those guys.
The song behind one of those guys.
I'm going to turn that off,
because that's disturbing.
So, I want to talk a little
bit about ecosystems.
In particular, I'm going to
talk about the music ecosystem.
So, the music ecosystem and YouTube
have a very symbiotic relationship.
The music industry really needs YouTube.
If you go look at a bunch
of different reports,
Nielsen will tell you that
people under a certain age
tend to use YouTube for music
more than terrestrial radio.
So, the music industry
has very much aligned
with figuring out how to
make this YouTube thing work.
The same was true in reverse for YouTube,
music is a very popular genre.
But even more importantly,
if you upload a video to
YouTube that has music in it,
we would license that on your behalf,
and share the revenue back
with the music labels.
So, that meant not only did we have to
deal with Taylor Swift's music video,
we had to deal with the
birthday party video
that had Taylor Swift in the background.
So, this was a really important
symbiotic relationship.
Which meant that negotiations
were always really tough,
and they would happen about
every three or four years.
So, 2011 we were going through
our set of negotiations
with the music labels,
spend an all day session
talking through lots of different things,
and then afterwards we
went out for drinks.
And I happened to be sitting next to
one of the other label executives,
and I asked him this question.
I said, I just want to know,
we just came out of a day
long very adversarial meeting.
I said, when is that tone going to change?
And the way I phrased the question was,
when is it going to be the case
that your relationship with YouTube
and your ability to be
successful on YouTube
actually helps you win clients?
The way a label works is,
they have to convince
artists to join their label.
Generally and historically the way
they used to convince them was, hey,
we have relationships with
all the record stores.
And then over time, it became,
we have a relationship
with all the radio DJs.
And I wanted to know,
when it's going to be
the case that you say, you
should be signed by me,
because I know how to make
you successful on YouTube?
And I threw out some hypotheses,
I said, is it going to be like
a certain amount of revenue?
A certain percentage
of an artists' revenue
has to come from YouTube.
Is it going to be of a
certain amount of viewership,
like that it has to reach a certain scale?
And, he kind of laughed and said,
no, no, no, it's not any of those things.
He said, you probably don't
want to know the answer.
I said, no, I want to know the answer.
He said, I'll tell you, it's one thing.
The revenue piece is not
really that important
because one of the secrets
of the music industry
is that most of the money
is actually not made on
any of these distribution channels,
it's mostly made in touring.
So most of these artists
are not that motivated
by the revenue coming
out of these channels.
And viewerships are similarly,
they just don't think that way.
But there's thing that
they are obsessed with.
Every artist you can
think of is obsessed with
where they stand on the Billboard charts.
And, the revenue goes up or down,
Scott, this guy was telling me,
I never got a call from anybody,
but if an artist drops from number two
to number four on the charts,
he's on the phone immediately.
What are you doing to fix this?
And I said oh, boy, that's
kind of interesting.
So we go, go home, go to bed.
Wake up, say, get together
with the team and said,
so what are we going to
do with this negotiation
to propose this idea?
I said, what would it take
for Billboard to actually use
YouTube data as a signal in its rankings?
And so we asked, has
anybody called Billboard?
Nope, nobody thought to call Billboard.
So, I said alright.
Well, maybe we should call Billboard.
Maybe they'll negotiate a
deal with us and let us do it.
So we call Billboard, and
not surprising in retrospect,
although surprisingly to us at the time,
they were super excited about it.
They said, of course we'd like to do it.
We like to report on whatever's popular,
YouTube seems to be where
people are listening to music.
We'd be happy to do it.
And they said, what do you want
to charge us for your data?
And we said, are you kidding?
We thought we'd have to pay
you to give you the data.
And they said, no, no, no, okay, fine.
So we decided to do it for free,
and we're going to send them all the data.
So we start this project
to send them all the data.
Actually their biggest question was,
how the hell are we going
to deal with all that data?
So, they wanted us to synthesize it
in a whole bunch of different ways,
to make it manageable for them.
And so we start this project,
and then we get a call from them
just a few weeks before launch
and they said, hey, we'd like
to launch a little bit early.
And, this was like, four
weeks before the launch.
And we said, in my history
of all these partnerships
I'd never heard of a partner
wanting to launch early,
and I said okay, why?
And they said, we really can't tell you,
but we'd like to launch tomorrow.
And we said, alright, well,
you have the data, it's up to you.
Go ahead and launch tomorrow.
And we found out the next day why,
and the reason was that this guy, Baauer,
ended up at number one on the charts.
This is particularly interesting because
at the time Billboard had been around for,
I think, 57 years.
and they'd never an
unknown, unsigned artist
debut at number one.
So he had no label, and he'd
never been on the chart before,
and he started at number one.
For us it was particularly interesting
because if you actually went and looked
at his views on YouTube,
none of them were on anything he uploaded.
This is the types of stuff you would see,
I guess it's too fuzzy here to see it.
Because people were taking his song
and making all these kinds of videos.
And so, that was really interesting to us.
The longterm impacts
of that were enormous.
It's still the case that
YouTube has now become
a primary vehicle for musicians,
and artists now invest a lot of energy
into their music viewership.
Often at the cost of other things,
partially because of a decision we made
to share out data with Billboard.
The lesson here is every business
operates in an ecosystem.
It doesn't matter how big you are,
there's sets of people
that you need to rely on.
And it's very easy to presume something
about their incentives if you don't ask.
So, what I'd suggest is don't presume,
go out, collect the data,
ask the real hard questions,
and you might find something completely
counter intuitive, like we did here.
Alright, let's talk about values.
Let me switch to my...
Alright, so we're going to
talk a bit about values.
As you scale, one of the
things that will matter a lot
is your sense of values.
The story I want to tell here
is from September 11th, 2012.
So, September 11th, 2012, we get a call
saying hey, there's been,
something terrible happened.
There was an attack on
the US embassy in Libya,
and the US ambassador
to Libya, Chris Stevens,
had been killed.
And the reason we got the call was
the world was convinced that it had to do
with this video, that this
was a series of protestors
that were protesting a video
called Innocence of Muslims.
And everyone wanted to know what we
were going to do about it.
Every government, every journalist,
everybody wanted to know what
we were going to do about it.
There were sort of compelling
arguments on both sides,
there was a series of people who
really, really wanted
to take the video down,
because it's just a stupid
video, just take it down.
If it can help save
even one person's life.
And there was a lot of growing,
every hour we were getting called saying,
hey, there's been another
protest in a different country,
and I've got the same thing
happening now in Yemen,
happening in Egypt, and it was kind of
spreading through the region.
And there was a set of arguments that way.
On the other hand,
our policy team could find
nothing wrong with the video.
They couldn't find any reason
for us to pull it down,
and so they were sort of staunchly arguing
that we should leave it alone,
and the next 24 hours were really tough.
And I got probably,
I think one of the best
short term educations
possible on how to think about the laws
across the world for freedom of speech,
hate speech, and incitement of violence.
The intersection of those laws is what
really had to be figured out in this case.
Now, that impact is, the
video actually stayed up,
except for a few select countries.
But, thankfully it was also determined
that the video actually
didn't have anything to do
with the assassination of the ambassador.
Now Hillary Clinton gets to
go deal with the rest of that.
Or got to at the time.
Yes, so, let's see.
But the reason I think
this is an important
lesson for this group is,
these days as these properties and
businesses get bigger and bigger,
we're sort of in an interesting spot where
the level of impact these
companies and products
can have is kind of unprecedented.
I mean, if you think about
that situation we were in,
we were the last decider.
Whether this thing stayed up or down.
There was no government that
could force us to do anything,
there was no group to go to,
there was no judge to
make a real call on it.
We were going to decide, and
we had to be ready to do it.
And I think one of the things
to think about as you scale,
hopefully if you get to the
point of working at a business
that has that level of impact,
it also comes with an enormous
amount of responsibility,
and you have to think about
your values in advance.
So that by the time you get hit by this,
you know you have some frame
in which to make those decisions.
Alright, I'm going to switch
gears and talk to my people.
Go ahead.
- It terms of like, how
bodies apply scaling,
how do you deal with all the situations
where for example, going into China,
such a huge market opportunity
but they're very tough about how
they want to pull it off,
or other countries that
have very different
understandings of freedom of speech.
I mean, how can you leave such a huge
part of the business on the table?
- So the question was roughly
how could you leave China on the table?
My perspective on that was,
well, it was two parts.
One, it wasn't really a choice.
For YouTube in particular,
and I think someone else should probably
speak to the Google piece of that,
but for YouTube in particular
there was no choice.
There was no real
opportunity to go into China.
I tried many different
tactics of ways to do it,
but there just wasn't a
practical way to do it.
In my opinion, I would have done it.
And in fact we did launch in a number of,
actually through experiences like that,
we launched YouTube in
all sorts of countries
where we didn't really
agree with quite their way
of doing business or
their form of government.
Because, you know, the trade.
And the way I would recommend it was,
I believe that allowing
people to express themselves,
even small amounts was better than
not being in the region at all.
But for China in particular,
it ended up being kind of a moot question.
Alright, let's switch
to talking about people.
So, you now pick the
right table to sit at,
you've figured out the right values,
you've figured out the right
thesis you want to invest in.
Now you need a crew,
you need a set of people that are actually
going to help you get this done.
And so I picked off a few things to
talk about in terms of
how to judge talent,
how to work with them yourself,
and how to organize them.
So, let's talk first
off on judging talent.
And so, I'll walk through this framework
in a second just to introduce
it, add some context.
This is framework that was
given to me by an old boss
for how to think about comparing people.
Generally framed in the notion of,
how do you tell the difference between
someone who's senior and
someone who's junior?
We applied this at Google across
a bunch of different functions.
It's being used for how
the product management
promotion committees, for example,
compare different levels
of product managers.
And generally the question
there was phrased as
what's the difference
between a level three
and a level six product manager?
Or a level three and a level six engineer?
And those terms, you don't have to
worry about the numbers.
Just, you can reframe that as,
what does it mean to be
a junior product manager,
versus a senior product
manager, and so on.
So we talked about at least two axes.
So, one axis that would generally
get referred to is scope.
And we'd say okay, the way
you should compare people is,
junior people would start off
and they'd work on features,
and then they'd gradually
work on groups of features,
and eventually they'd work
on areas of a product,
and then they'd cover a whole product,
and then they'd cover
multiple different products,
and that's how you should
judge junior versus senior,
is the scope of the thing that
they've got ownership for.
We proposed a slightly different
axis for looking at this
with an acronym that does
not make a word at all.
It's PSHE.
It stands for problem,
solution, how, execution.
I'll walk it from the bottom up.
So, you start off as a junior employee.
Someone hands you a problem,
someone hands you the rough solution,
and says this is how we're
going to solve the problem.
They give you a list of
how, a list of instructions.
Say what you should do,
is you go meet his person,
you should assemble this group,
you should write this document,
and these are the things you have to do
in order to implement the solution.
And the job of the
person is to go execute.
Go follow these instructions,
and that's the job.
And then gradually that person
becomes a little more senior,
and gets handed a problem,
and gets handed a solution,
but now that person has
to figure out the how.
Figure out who to talk to,
how to set up the team,
what the cadence should
be, whatever that I mean.
And then at the next stage the
person becomes a little more senior,
gets handed a problem with no solution,
the job of the person is to
go figure out the solution
and at some point in that person's career,
they're handed a space
and they have to come back
and tell you what the problems are.
And decide where to focus on.
So, this is a progression
we use to think about
how to evaluate people a lot.
You could put different
labels on this axis.
People like to call it leadership.
I like to use the term training wheels.
In fact, the way I like to phrase this is
if you were to put the two axis together,
as to say, given this person,
what's the biggest scope you could hand
this person with no training wheels?
What amount of support do
they need to get started?
There's a couple sort of counter
intuitive things about this.
So, one was, the path
that people generally took
in evolving through these
stages generally wasn't linear.
In fact, what generally happened is,
early in peoples' career, they would be
sort of growing by growing scope.
And at some point the curve would turn
almost completely to the other direction
and it would be less about the scope
and more about some of the mechanisms
about how they did the job,
and then gradually it
would turn back at the top.
And this period in the middle,
I call this the trough of disillusionment.
And put it in terms of
a promotion committee,
so you're sitting there,
you're trying to decide
if this level three
person's a level six person,
how do you tell the difference?
And the way I would phrase it is,
the difference between
a level three person
and a level six person had
nothing to do with scope,
they could be doing the same job.
It was much more about
how they did the job
than the job they did.
Which makes it much,
much harder to evaluate
how good a job they're doing.
But this frame of thinking
about how people grow
was very helpful in trying to figure out,
and we use this across disciplines.
Trying to figure out what
does success really look like,
and how do people grow through it?
A second tool I want to talk about
is something we use called Dream Teams.
And this tool, the basic
idea here is really simple.
We would take groups of people
and we'd ask a single question.
The question was,
who would you hire first if you
were starting this team from scratch?
And we used to call it
the dream team question,
and we used to ask in a whole
bunch of different ways.
We'd ask managers for their teams,
we'd ask peers for people
on their collective teams,
and so on, and try to form a view
on what the dream teams were.
And then we'd take that list
and we would generally draw three lines.
So, the first line is, we
call it the awesome bar.
So those are the set of people
you sort of build a team around.
At the other end of the spectrum was the
we probably wouldn't have
hired this person again bar.
And then there was a middle line
that I called the hiring bar.
Just to explain each one, so the top one--
Well, actually, let's
start at the other end.
The wouldn't hire again bar.
First off, there was no
set place to draw that bar,
it was entirely qualitative.
You could draw that bar and say
there's nobody underneath that,
you could draw the bar and put
the whole team underneath that.
But the exercise was to
be intellectually honest
with how you feel about the team,
and there's a set of steps we would take
when people were under that bar.
I'll come back in just a second.
At the other end of the
spectrum was the awesome bar,
and that's really where you
want to invest your time.
You take those set of people,
you spent your time talking about them,
you spend your time
making sure they feel like
they're valued, make sure that they are
working on challenging things.
We would rotate them
through teams regularly
to try and make sure
that they were getting
exposed to new areas of product,
getting challenged in different ways.
The one in the middle, the hiring bar,
was sort of interesting too.
It's very natural in an organization
to set your hiring bar at the same place
as the wouldn't hire again bar.
We need somebody to replace Joe,
so just get me somebody
that's better than Joe.
And it's a very natural
organizational instinct to say,
or the other way it gets phrased is,
well, we hired that person,
and this other person
seems just about as good,
so we should just do the same thing.
And so we would set the hiring bar,
and the YouTube hiring committee's
actually had a list of people.
And so it wasn't a list of qualities,
so it wasn't they can
write code this fast,
or they can design at this
speed, or whatever it might,
whatever synthetic metrics
you might come up with,
we would say, hey, we've
decided our hiring bar
is way up here, and as
you evaluate candidates,
we'd like you think about these four,
five frames of reference
of people we think
are emblematic of those capabilities.
And there's lots of tactics there
to talk about if people are interested in,
but the main lessons I
wanted to express is,
you can pick whichever tools you like,
if you like those two
tools, then go ahead,
you could pick different ones.
But thinking about the ways
you're going to judge people.
For example, this way of
judging has perspective.
There's many leaders who
would pick a very different
set of things that they would order.
This is my perspective on how
I think about how people grow,
and it was reflected in the team.
And there were leaders
that had a different set,
like you could almost express
that this is my set of values.
And then thinking about how you want to
manage that across your team,
and make sure that you're
spending your energy
on the top of your team.
Not on your bottom.
It's a really hard thing to do,
but a very important thing to do.
Go ahead, what's your question?
- Yeah, I just wanted to make sure I
was going to say it correctly,
But who would you hire first,
and the three lines thing,
are they completely separate exercises?
- No, no, same exercise.
You build your list, you
say who would I hire first,
and you sort of end up with
an ordered list of people,
and then you draw lines within that list.
- And this was always like,
at the mid point or the end
of a project, presumably?
- So, we would do it every quarter,
and so we do it on a time cadence.
But sorry, I should be reading questions.
The question was, what's
the cadence for doing it?
We would do it every quarter.
I actually think that doing it
more frequently is actually better,
and if you have the
right tools for doing it,
you can do it pretty quickly.
Go ahead, question there.
The question was, do you
fire anyone based on it?
So, I was in the luxurious
position of being at a company
that people fought like crazy to get into.
So, generally speaking,
people that were below that bottom line,
once they were told that
they were below that line,
they generally made the right choices.
This is not a rule I
would apply everywhere,
I've been in situations
where that's not true,
but that was sort of the
notion of how it worked for us,
but in some cases, absolutely, we did.
I think building that muscle,
and to how you think
about your top and bottom
as a part of making sure,
the only way to make sure
you have a healthy team
is to treat your top
very well and make sure
that your bottom doesn't
stay along for very long.
Alright, let's talk about your roles.
Now, you're leading this team.
There's lots of different
things to talk about
as your role changes,
you become a manager.
You become a manager,
managers at some point,
you're running a bunch of functions,
many functions where you don't even
actually understand what they do.
Lots of different things
to talk about there.
I picked one to talk about,
which is how to be a bad manager.
And I'll come back to why that implies
something about being a good manager.
I think there's three
ways to be a bad manager.
So, one is the one that's
most typically talked about,
it's being a micromanager.
That's sort of an easy
example to understand,
is somebody comes to you with a problem,
and you take the problem
from them and you solve it.
The downsides to that I
think are well understood.
I think another one is, another pattern,
is what I call dictators.
And you tend to see this a lot
more in sales organizations.
The story I would tell is,
you're the sales leader
is sitting down with their sales rep,
and the sales rep comes in and says,
alright, I had a ten million
dollar quota this quarter,
but I just wanted to let you know
I had two major customers in that quota.
And one of them, the
company went bankrupt,
and the other one, the head
of the company passed away.
And I just wanted to let you know.
And the sales manager sits there and says,
I kind of blanked out for a second
and I may not have heard everything,
but are you still bringing me
10 million dollars this quota, or not?
And that's sort of the spirit
of those types of leaders.
There's a third one, I call
these the overempathizers.
And this person is slightly
different than either of those.
So, that person, employee
brings a problem,
and a manager sits,
listens very carefully,
doesn't take the problem from them,
but spends all their energy trying
to debug the problem with them.
Says, oh, tell me more about it,
maybe it's because of this,
maybe it's because of that, and so on.
And that may seem like a
really good thing to do,
but one of the implications of that
is now you've taken the responsibility off
of that person and onto yourself.
The main lesson of this is,
I think everybody has
their natural tendency.
And you probably all know
where your natural tendency is.
Mine, by the way, is at the top.
In any team I work with
I make sure they know that.
That's where I end up in
if pushed.
And I think being a good manager
is actually not about being
any one of these things.
It's about being able to be these things
when you need to be.
And sometimes the right thing
to do is to be a dictator,
sometimes the right thing
to do is be a micromanager,
sometimes the right
thing to do is empathize.
But understanding which
one you naturally are
and stretching yourself in the other ones
is really important.
And one way to think about it is,
the goal of the manager
is set inspiring goals,
coach when needed,
and hold people accountable.
And those can often be
at odds with each other.
Alright, one last one.
I'm going to talk a little bit
about how to organize teams.
And again, lots of different things
we could talk about there.
How do you organize functions,
how do you organize projects?
How do you move people around, do you not?
So, on this one principle that I found,
we used all the time.
And it's told with a story.
So the story is, this guy walks
up to these three workers,
and asks them what they're working on.
And the first one says,
hey, I'm responsible for taking bricks.
I take bricks from over there
and I put them over there.
And then he goes to the second guy,
and says, what are you working on?
And he says, oh, I'm
responsible for laying bricks.
I take those bricks and I put the mortar
and I stick them on top of each other,
and that's what I do.
And he goes to the third guy
and he says, what are you responsible for?
And he says, well, I'm
here to build a cathedral.
And this difference I
think is really critical
as you think about how you
set up projects and teams.
And hopefully the lesson is clear,
people that are working on a cathedral,
sort of similar to the purpose stuff
we talked about at the beginning.
The people working on a cathedral
have a higher sense of purpose,
better set of perspective
on what they're doing,
and so on.
So, when we first talked
about this at YouTube,
we talked about it in offsite,
and someone asked for an example.
So just to give you the example,
we asked one of the managers
in the team to stand up.
This manager stands up,
and I said, so, explain to everybody else
what you're responsible for.
And that person said, oh, I
run the related videos team.
I said, okay, what's
the related videos team?
Well, our job is, when you
come to watch a YouTube video,
there's all those videos like on
the right side of the watch page.
Our job is to pick which videos go there.
And I asked everybody around the room,
which did that sound like?
Did that sound like laying bricks
or did that sound like
building a cathedral?
And that led to a conversation
where that team's goal was
reframed and broadened,
and we changed how we thought
about that experience.
But the main lesson I would give is,
as you think about organizing teams,
and setting up goals,
what's one of the hardest things to do,
but the question to be asked is,
when you look at each person,
and look at their team,
and you kind of work your
way through the organization,
is how connected do people
feel to a cathedral,
and do they describe it as a cathedral,
or do they describe it as laying bricks?
So those are 10 hopefully
interesting stories,
some about how to pick things
that have high tailwinds,
pick things where you have
a high sense of purpose.
As you execute, look for those theses.
Look for that thing that you believe
that not everybody else believes.
Try to find that unifying metric.
Try to make decisions that stick.
Look hard at your ecosystem to find
counter intuitive patterns.
Think about your values
before they're tested.
And as you're building up your team,
think about the ways you
want think about talent,
and measure them.
What type of manager you are,
and how to structure your
team around cathedrals,
not just projects.
- So, can you say a little bit more about
what that, you sort of mentioned,
there were two main periods of YouTube.
So there was the period of,
there was a fire lit under you
and everyone thought
you were going to fail,
and then there was the sort
of period of wandering,
sort of followed after that.
Describe what things were like
at the beginning of the
period, you were going to fail?
How big was the team?
What was the area of focus?
And how close were you still
to the founding essence
of what YouTube was?
- So, just to be clear,
I would probably describe YouTube as,
probably say there's probably four phases.
So, there was the founding phase
that was mainly before
YouTube was purchased.
And it was before I joined the team,
so I know a lot of it only secondhand.
After the purchase, the dynamics changed.
And then there was the what I
called the wandering period,
and then I think the phase
that YouTube is currently in,
which I would call acceleration.
Actually, I think that seems
to be going incredibly well.
So, I can talk about the
sort of the last three,
the first one's a little bit different.
And YouTube is a very unique case,
I don't know that a lot
of business go through
this kind of dip.
But YouTube got, on one side
was an enormous success.
Bought for 1.6 billion
dollars at the time.
It seemed like a lot of money before a
whole bunch of other
acquisitions got done.
And was a very property
popular property, and so on.
But we were, our backs were to the wall.
It was a very common conversation of,
could this be shut down,
could it be spun out?
It wasn't a forgone conclusion
that YouTube would be allowed to continue.
I'll tell one story to
help people understand
what that felt like.
So, we were, let's say this was,
it must have been like
October 18th or 19th,
it was three or four days after
my second daughter was born.
I go into work, which my
wife was not happy about,
and meet with Patrick
Pichette, who's our CFO.
At the time, this was sort
of my first meeting with him.
You know, I'd joined YouTube
about a month earlier
and he had three charts in front of him.
And he was totally ready for this meeting.
And one was, here's how much money
YouTube is losing per year,
and it was a lot of money.
The second one was, here's how much money
YouTube is losing per view.
And that was not,
that was enough money.
And then there was a third one that said,
here's what views are doing.
And views weren't doing this,
they were doing this.
He said, this is the worst
business on the planet.
There's been a lot of talk recently about
negative gross margin
businesses, and so on.
We were like the worst.
So, I would say, on one side,
it was incredibly focusing.
Everybody completely understood
what needed to be done,
which meant across all functions.
Obviously the monetization team
was under a lot of
pressure to find some way
to create an ad unit, and some
of the stuff I talked about.
But it also meant things like,
the networking team was shaving
costs as fast as possible,
and the content team was
constantly renegotiating
and rethinking how we dealt
with content licenses,
and the viewership team was thinking about
creative ways to rebuild the experience
around this goal.
So it was very clarifying, so I would say
at that time, the
sentiment would be intense,
it would be intense, but
you'd make resolutions fast,
and you'd go do them.
I'd say that wandering period was tough,
because it, all of a sudden,
it was kind of like we went from this
totally nimble, small company,
to feeling very big all of a sudden.
How do you pick between
doing project A or project B?
Well, they're all going
to move us forward,
they all seem good, so
everything gets funded,
everything kind of moves.
Which kind of means nothing moves.
It meant all the projects
kind of intersect each other.
All of sudden people are working on things
that don't have alignment.
One of the ways I like to describe it is,
in a healthy dynamic,
somebody brings up a new project,
and says, hey, I want do,
you're working on A, I'm working on B,
here's project C.
In a healthy dynamic,
both A and B first off,
they're too busy to even do it.
So, a healthy dynamic
is, we're already racing,
Johnathan Rosenberg used
to do the analogy of,
I'm going to drop this ball
in the middle of table.
In a healthy dynamic, the
ball should drop on the floor.
I should have to force people
to go do the new thing.
And then when somebody picks it up,
everybody is super supportive,
because that's the nature
of that business he's going.
And I would say, for
temporarily, that changed.
And I think we managed to change it back,
but it wasn't easy.
- So, in that period at the beginning,
when you were making the big push
to get the costs down, get the revenue up,
and so forth, and turn YouTube
into an effective business.
What were key org changes you had to make,
in order to make that successful?
- I mean, I would say the organization
actually didn't matter a ton.
I think the people mattered a lot.
And, so I would say, we
were pretty active on that.
The tolerance for a not
stellar person in a role
was incredibly low then.
We moved people out of
positions incredibly fast,
just because we couldn't,
we didn't have time to wait to see
if something was going to work out.
Because clearly that person
wasn't working, we move fast.
And on the other side,
we pulled in the best help
from anywhere we could.
And sometimes that was,
sometimes actually, one
interesting story is,
so I told the story about
TrueView's ad format,
I was mentioning it took a long time
to actually get it shipped.
It took almost three
years to get it shipped.
So a lot of actually what
we did to write the ship
was done without it.
That project actually got shelved,
I couldn't get it through the sales team.
And so we didn't launch it for a while,
and there was a guy on the sales team
who really, really wanted
to be a product manager.
And was really smart, and so
we decided to give him a shot,
but we couldn't move him over.
And, so I said, here's the deal.
I'll let you do it in your 20 percent time
as long as you keep
doing your current job,
and you have to take this project
that's gotten shelved and I
really want to see it work.
And so I think we got really creative
about how to get the right
people in the right problems,
because you're sort of
motivated the right direction.
- You mentioned earlier
when you were talking,
about how valuable having
that single target metric
was for the entire organization.
What's the process you put in place
for company communications?
I mean, one of things
which has really changes
as the company sort of grows
is the way in which you talk
to the staff as a whole.
So, that very clarifying
meeting you had with the CFO,
how did you communicate that
effectively to the team?
And how is that different
than in the future,
when you came up with that one metric?
- So I'm a big believer in,
and there's a lot of different
communication forums,
and we used to do a lot of the ones
I think these days are pretty standard,
cross companies would do the TGIFs,
you do Q and As and so on.
I was a pretty big believer in writing
a weekly mail.
And, actually as a general sentiment,
I think I didn't talk about here,
but I'd say, leaders
that write things down.
There's a lot of reasons to
write or not write things down,
but I think leaders
that write things down,
tend to deal with less
communication issues.
I would say, to say it differently,
writing it down generally
meant you had to clairfy
your thought process in a
completely different way.
It's very easy to leave a meeting
with okay, we decided this thing,
everyone go tell your team
to go tell their team,
and they'll tell their teams,
and first off, everybody
doesn't quite know
what was decided, and so,
if you didn't write it
down, and then suddenly
you're going to play
this game of telephone.
Of you know, I wasn't there,
but the person who was there told,
said that this thing happened, and so on.
So, I used to send a
weekly YouTube all mail,
that would to go to everyone.
Robert would do something very similar.
And we would lay out,
some of it was updates.
Here's things that happened.
And generally we would try
to pick something like,
we made this hard decision,
and we want people to understand why.
And I think that was pretty effective
at communicating things like that.
He had a question.
- So, let's actually go ahead, please.
- As you mentioned earlier in the talk
that Sal Kahn couldn't
have been able to create
his business three or four years earlier,
how do you think about timing in terms
of product and business biz?
- So I'm just repeating it so,
Sal Kahn wouldn't have been able to
make his business happen
three or four years earlier.
How do you think about timing
when it comes to this space?
- Timing was actually one of
the stories I ended up cutting.
I think timing is critically important,
and unfortunately it's
really hard to predict.
It's kind of related to the
tailwind point I talked about.
YouTube was far from the first
at trying to make online video work.
I've had many arguments with Mark Cuban
about whether he was the first or not.
- I bet I know what he thinks.
(laughing)
- The timing is kind of everything.
And unfortunately, you don't actually know
if you're at the right
time until afterwards.
I don't know that there's
a prescription there.
But certainly I think, once you feel it,
maybe that's related to the insight
of what do you believe that
other people don't believe.
Sometimes that is entirely about timing,
that you believe the right set of things
are coming together to make it happen
I mean, why was YouTube
timing at the right time?
There's a lot of things that
happened at that moment.
I mean, networks were finally big enough
to be able to stream video.
We were finally putting a phone,
sorry, a camera in everyone's pocket.
So the amount of creation that was
happening was completely different.
And then there's a bunch of things in the
funding and investment environment
that made it easier to imagine
taking something that
was actually a pretty
capital intensive bet that
actually made that work.
And there's a whole bunch of things
that had to come together
at the right moment
for that to happen,
and a lot of luck comes into it too.
Timing really matters.
- Please.
- So you mentioned at the
beginning of your talk
(talking) broadband to
cable, to internet video,
which has totally shaped the industry.
How do you think virtual
reality will change things?
- So how do you think that virtual reality
is going to play that
its role is the next step
in the transformation of entertainment?
- How do I think that
virtual reality will change?
Let's see.
John's in the back,
and John and I have
talked about this before.
I think virtual reality right now is
a fantastic promise.
I think the timing of it is unclear.
Anybody who's put on an Oculus
and gone through one of those demos,
you can't help but being wowed.
It is really amazing to see it.
And yet, I think one of
my lessons from YouTube
was you know, the shift I talked about,
with going from broadband,
to cable, to internet video.
You can go back to the late
90s and you'll find the same.
You can go back earlier and
you'll find very similar ideas.
But the set of things
that have to come together
for virtual reality to get
there are sort of similar,
in terms of the network effects of devices
and content and applications,
and all of that coming
together at the same time.
So, I don't have a guess
on when that'll be.
I don't think it's quite yet,
but I do think it will
be great when it happens.
- One more question, go ahead.
- Yeah, you talked about wanting to start
a company a couple of times.
What made you decide the last time,
where it's time to drop it or do it?
Did you have the idea,
team, all those things?
- You had the opportunity
a couple of times
to start a company, and you've
finally gone and done it,
so what's changed in the
decision making process
from when you decided
not to do it in the past?
- That's a good question.
So, essentially when I was at YouTube
and people would come to me and say,
I want to start a company,
I used to ask them two questions.
Generally, as a way to
discourage them, actually.
And my two questions were,
do you have an idea you
can't imagine not working on?
And do you have a person or team
you can't imagine not working with?
And my view of that way I
would phrase the question is,
if you don't have both,
then you shouldn't do it.
And generally that was enough
to dissuade a lot of people.
As it turned out, most people
had one or not the other,
or sometimes had neither,
which I think was
particularly interesting.
(laughing)
I'm not so sure those questions
have led to the right startup,
that's like, as a life choice,
that's how I think about it.
For me, the simple answer is,
I found myself answering
both those questions as yes,
and once you're at that point,
I think anyone who's started a company
will kind of describe it the same way.
It's a feeling of like, damn, I'm trapped.
Like, I have to do it.
You can't imagine not doing it,
an that's when you have to do it.
And that was the feeling I had,
and so I did it.
- So, we're going to break now,
because we're right out of time.
- I can stick around, if
people want to ask questions.
- That would be awesome,
I was going to ask.
So, thank you very much for joining us.
