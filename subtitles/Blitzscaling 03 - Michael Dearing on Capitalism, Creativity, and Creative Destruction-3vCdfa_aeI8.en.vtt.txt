- [Voiceover] So welcome,
great to see you all here.
This class what we're
going to do is two parts,
the first part is Michael is going to give
a lecture that he has prepared which
I am actually looking forward to,
I've actually gotten some preview of it
and I actually brought my cards
to take notes because
I'm also going to have
the privilege of leading the questions.
We have selected questions from the things
that you guys have submitted already
and I have those on index cards
in addition to my own
and I'll interweave them,
I've actually sent them all to Michael
in the just in time basis
about 45 minutes ago,
so he's now computing like,
oh, those are the questions that'll
come after the lecture.
And so as a quick introduction to Michael,
Michael teaches at the D school,
he actually teaches entrepreneurship
he runs a very successful early stage
venture capital practice
called Harrison Metal.
The way that Michael and I met
is I tried two or three
times to recruit him
to LinkedIn to which he
told me no each time,
we'll get to that maybe more in the Q &amp; A
but he is an excellent investor,
an excellent product guy
and an excellent scale executive
so we asked him to come and share some
of his wisdom with us.
That's it.
- Thank you for the invitation.
(laughs) This is gonna
be a little strange,
but I'm gonna ask you to come with me
back in time.
And I want to talk to you about a hero
of capitalism who's long dead,
that's the footnote from Beyond the Grave.
Poor John Lilly is
stuck flipping my slides
- [Reid] We're fixing
that for the next class.
(John laughs)
- Awesome.
Okay so let's dive into
heroes of capitalism.
The first thing that I want
to give you context for,
and believe me this all
does tie right back to
startups and entrepreneurship I promise.
The first thing I want to give you is
a thousand years of context.
I want to give you a thousand years
of reasons why what we're talking about
in this room matters.
If you can see this and read the title,
just digest it for a second
and then maybe somebody give us a guided
tour of this slide,
this exhibit.
What is this?
- [Student] Exponential growth.
- Of?
(unclear response)
GDP per capita, right?
So it's the economic output
of every person on
earth from the year 1000
to the year 2000.
I wish I had the brain
power to come up with
this dataset but I don't.
But I did steal it from a person named
J. Bradford DeLong who
teaches economics at Berkeley.
And Professor DeLong did his study,
his paper was actually
estimating world GDP
one million BC to the present.
I cut the million part off,
the million to one thousand part because
the answer is it's really low.
(laughter)
And this tells the story
well enough for me.
So therefore it works for you too.
So real GDP per capita constant dollars,
over time, over a thousand year span
on a semi-log scale.
So what we're able to do here is to see
an incredible change in the circumstances
of being human on earth.
Give me your thoughts about this curve.
When you look at it what are some of
the features that jump out at you,
some of the landmarks that
really stand out to you.
(indistinct response)
Yeah.
Roundabout the 13th century,
any guesses what that is?
- [Students] The plague.
- The plague.
Yeah, yeah.
In case you ever do build a time machine
please do not put the settings to that
because you'll have a one in three chance
of not coming home.
The population drop was precipitous,
particularly in Europe.
And so the productivity,
is really what GDP per capita is
is productivity collapsed.
Now if we go forward in time,
what else do you notice about this curve?
- [Student] Industrial revolution?
- Industrial revolution
and where do you see
that beginning?
(indistinct response)
Yeah.
This inflection point,
kind of hard to miss right?
It's the most obvious
feature of this chart,
with the exception of
the incredible amount
of flatness over the preceding 700 years.
So the flatness with the extra painful dip
really bad.
Have you ever lived through
a low-growth situation?
Now try doing that for 30 generations.
That would suck.
This inflection point
industrial revolution,
anybody remember from maybe other
history courses you've taken
or just your own readings,
what were some of the
big things that happened
to make that inflection point possible?
- [Student] I heard that
it's correlated nicely
with the construction of coffee shops.
- Really.
(laughter)
- [Student] (indistinct)
... and you can correlate this graph with
the rise of coffee shops, not Starbucks.
(laughter)
(indistinct speaking)
- That's fascinating but I buy it.
The exchange of ideas--
certainly something changed here
with respect to think about
the density of population in some
of the cities,
the mobility of people to be able
to spend time with one another.
Mostly because they weren't in
the fields trying to come up with
their next meal, right,
they had some more free
time to exchange ideas.
Yeah what else do you think happened here?
- [Student] So like coffee
shops like Lloyd's of London,
the first insurance company was founded
in a coffee shop by a guy named Lloyd
in London near the docks.
- Okay.
- [Student] So once
people were able to have
insurance for business
ventures they could go
in and take more risks.
And therefore--
it's riskful work so you could have
a much greater potential income
if you do take risks...
(indistinct)
- Okay so in that sense you might actually
go back to Adam Smith and say
the division of labor there started
to get more granular.
There were specialists in provision
of coffee, the provision of insurance
there might have been specialists
in the invention of new technologies.
I want to read to you--
- [Student] Where?
America.
(laughter)
So that falls into the bucket of like,
heavily loaded one line
class participation.
(laughter)
So give me the highlights of what you mean
by America.
- [Student] 1776 America was founded.
- Yeah.
(laughter)
This is the spirit that
made America great,
is the willingness in your first year
of undergraduate.
Right, you're a freshman.
(laughter and applause)
No I'm dead serious,
this is the courage that we depend on
to fuel that curve.
I want to read to you a paragraph,
we'll come back to this I promise,
I'm not blowing you off but I need
to think a little bit about how to respond
to you so I'm gonna stall
by reading Schumpeter.
Joseph Schumpeter wrote this book,
Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy
and he wrote it in the late 1930s,
early 1940s.
And the paragraph I want to read to you
I think is really special.
You'll probably recognize
some of these terms
when we get to them.
This is Schumpeter
writing about capitalism.
Writing about this.
The opening up of new markets,
foreign or domestic and the organizational
development from the craft shop
and factory to such concerns as U.S. steel
illustrate the same process
of industrial mutation,
if I may use a biological term,
that incessantly
revolutionizes the economic
structure from within,
incessantly destroying the old one,
incessantly creating a new one.
This process of Creative Destruction,
capital C, capital D,
is the essential fact of capitalism.
Schumpeter believed this
was due to entrepreneurship.
It was due to people you never heard of
starting businesses you couldn't
quite believe were real,
completely unsettling the economic output
model for the economy.
A couple other things
happened at this time too.
One was plentiful sources of cheap energy
became available in the form of
coal, steam, eventually
oil in the early part
of the 20th century
so that the scale of the inventions,
the inventions that these entrepreneurs
came up with,
the scale could be many, many times
greater than anything
that had been seen before.
Humans didn't suddenly become
a creative species in the late 1700s.
They just started to get bigger levers
and gears to turn the
machines they built with.
So power was a huge part of this.
The revolution in technical innovation,
in transportation like the railroads,
in mechanization like spinning cotton,
all of those things played a huge role
in that inflection point.
The other person--
John if you could flip ahead, thank you.
The other person that's really important
to know about is this person,
Al Chandler.
Al Chandler founded the Discipline
of Business History at the
Harvard Business School.
Before he retired and sadly passed away,
I had a chance to spend
a lot of time with him
and his colleagues at Harvard.
Chandler's view was Schumpeter's right.
Entrepreneurs play an
incredibly central role
in the process of industrial capitalism,
in the growth of output,
in the wealth of humanity.
But managers play an
equally important role
in amplifying the genius
of those creative founders.
Chandler's whole view was that
the managerial revolution,
which scaled with these companies.
Remember the entrepreneurs came up with
the technology,
the company scaled
because of energy sources,
they had to be managed at a scale that was
unlike anything ever
seen before in history.
And so Chandler says that this invention
of managerial capitalism
was a fundamentally
new invention that came
with industrialization.
So what do we have?
We have this painfully flat period
of about 700 or 800 years,
we have this rapid change in direction
of output per person on the planet Earth,
by the way totally unequally shared,
correlates beautifully
with population growth,
collapse in infant mortality,
the widespread availability of education,
medicine, et cetera.
The increase in the dirtiness of our air,
some would argue the
temperature of the planet,
this is a mix of things here happening.
But all of the terrible
things that came before it,
now we finally have an engine
that can pay the bill to fix those things
that are horrifying about life on Earth.
Slavery, war for food, all of these things
were commonplace in this period.
They were invented long before capitalism.
Capitalism finally gave us an engine
to pay the bill to get
rid of these things.
This is the context,
the thousand year context that I want
to have in our mind when we
talk about entrepreneurship.
Yeah?
- [Student] (unclear question)
- Well if I understand
the point correctly,
yes the ability of the colonial powers
to distribute technology,
ways of work, legal structures,
not by choice but by force
was a huge driver of economic growth
in this period.
But what's interesting
about industrialization
in each of the countries
where it happened,
first in Britain then in the United States
and now in places like China and India
in the last half-century,
it always comes with an
expansion of political freedom.
It always comes with an expansion
of personal freedom,
it always comes with
the writing of terrible
hundred year, many
centuries old injustices.
And we're gonna come back
to that topic in a second.
Go ahead.
The other thing to note that connects you
and what you're talking about in this room
to the really important
stuff in human history,
the money that comes to Silicon Valley
to fund these startups,
to fund entrepreneurship,
to fund the creative destruction of today.
It doesn't come from the wealthy fat cats,
some of it does,
but a lot of it,
most of it comes from
research institutions,
universities, museums,
foundations, hospitals,
the guardians of civilization.
So this cycle of Creative Destruction
that drives economic productivity
that spins off wealth that comes back
and fuels institutions,
that is something to
be very, very aware of.
The cycle is all linked.
No pressure, but it's your
turn to drive this train.
We've got to understand
the Schumpeterian view
of entrepreneurs as the engine
of Creative Destruction.
We've got to embrace
the role of managerial
capitalism to scale and amplify
the genius of those founders.
We've got to use to proceeds
of whatever we create
to make that situation--
make our situation better
to eliminate those
things that are terrible
about being on earth
that have been around for a long time.
Poverty, injustice, ignorance,
sickness, et cetera.
No pressure but
civilization depends on you.
There are three really fascinating parts
of this curve.
I've zoomed in here just to reorient.
Same curve zoomed in on period
1800 to 2000.
And there's three separate
periods in that window
that are really interesting.
The first is the mechanization
of manufactured cotton.
The second is the
transportation revolution,
characterized mainly by the railroads,
the railroads of Western Europe
and the United States
and third the technology revolution
of Silicon Valley and the modern age
that we know so well.
We're going to zoom in
kind of right about here.
Early on--
No we're not gonna do Slater's Mill today,
although we could.
We're gonna do railroads.
Sorry I left a Slater's
Mill slide in there.
The thing to know about railroads
is that they were startups once.
They were startups once.
This is a locomotive that was manufactured
in 1830 in the UK.
And at one time this was a startup
very much like the startups that you know
and love of today in Silicon Valley.
And the startups were run by
people like this.
This is Daniel McCallum
and he's the hero of capitalism
who's going to speak to us
from Beyond the Grave today.
This is him in later life obviously,
but when he started out
he came to America in 1822,
he was born in Scotland,
his family moved to Upstate New York
when he was just seven years old.
He came to Upstate New York from Scotland,
he looked at what his
father did for a living,
his dad was a tailor,
and he decided the tailoring thing
is not so much for me.
So he started to think about
what else he could do.
Very young boy 12, 13 years old
began to work with wood.
He taught himself how to build
practically anything with wood.
He ended up creating something called
The McCallum Arched Truss Bridge
which got him a patent.
He became something of a magician
with wood-working and with bridge-making.
So self taught woodworker became
self taught architect
became patented architect
was hired by the New
York and Eerie Railroad
to be the bridge apprentice
in Upstate New York.
He was then promoted--
this was all the span of a couple years
in between each of these milestones--
he was then promoted to head of bridges,
to superintendent of bridges pardon me,
for the entire line,
then was given a general manager promotion
to the head of the Susquehanna branch
of the railroad
and then finally become the CEO
of the entire railroad
when he was about 43 years old.
So this was somebody,
if you just looked at
his career you would say
this is about as
entrepreneurial as it gets.
Son of immigrants decided he had no
future prospects in
the tailoring business,
decided to go into something he loved
working with wood,
continued to get promoted
and create a career for himself
out of thin air.
Found himself inside a company
that had once been a startup
that he knew well and loved
as a local member of the team
in Upstate New York,
but then got promoted to be the head
of the whole thing.
And let me give you a sense of the scope
of the whole thing.
This is his bridge by the way.
The nice thing about this bridge
is it lasted a lot longer than typical
bridge designs and it
required substantially
less maintenance.
And so you can imagine why in the
capital constrained
early days of railroads
that would be a really good thing for
the railroads to have.
So this was his claim to fame,
he built many of these bridges
throughout the Northeast.
This is the scope of his operation.
He started out as a maybe third or fourth
rung employee in Upstate New York
on one of those tiny red lines
and he ended up running this whole thing.
So why does this matter I thought we
were talking about startups,
not big huge enterprises?
It matters because McCallum in 1855
wrote a beautiful letter to his boss.
And the letter he wrote to his boss,
you can have it it's online.
It's one of the earliest
writings that survived
anybody saying here's what I think
about general management,
here's why it matters what we do
as general managers.
And in this document he writes about
the incredible--
the relative ease and fun and joy
he got working on a small railroad
of 50 miles long in Upstate New York,
and compared it to the toil and suffering
and awfulness of trying to run a road
ten times or 100 times longer.
And so McCallum wrote this letter
to his boss just to say
we gotta rethink how we do this
because we've lost,
essentially, he says it in a more
19th century hard to understand way,
but he says we've lost what made it easy
and fun running a small company
because now we're trying to run
this big behemoth.
Does that make sense?
And this goes very far West,
I mean this is all the way into Kansas
territory 1850s so you get the idea.
I will save you--
you should go read this letter,
but I will save you all
of the pain and suffering
of reading it if you don't want to
and tell you what he says.
He says the joy of
running that 50 mile road
was because I could see
people with my own eyes,
I could talk to them with my own voice,
I could get the group of people
to work on the right
stuff at the right time.
I could give those people responsibility
because I knew who they were.
I had a personal connection to them.
I was also able to make
sure the job was getting
done day in day out because I was
putting my own eyes on the problem.
And in that 50 mile road
in the startup railroad,
I knew how things were going because
I could see the trains moving or not,
I could see the freight
coming and going or not.
It was always very visible to me.
And also in the 50 mile road
we had a relationship with each other
we had respect for each other
and we talked to each
other like human beings.
In the 500 mile road
or the 5,000 mile road
all of this went away.
And so McCallum was struggling to say
how do I bring back what I loved about
the small road to the big road.
And these are the five questions
that he asked his boss.
He of course had an answer
for each one of these,
for example how do you make
sure the job gets done?
His answer was you get
on the freakin' telegraph
and every hour you tell me
how it's going in Nebraska.
And you tell me in this format
so my clerk can write it on the board
and I can stand in New York City
and I can see how it's going
out in the Hinterlands.
And every hour on the hour
you send this formatted update
back and forth using telegraph
and that's how I replicate
the visibility I had
at the small company level
to the big company level.
Does this make sense?
Any observations about this list,
anything surprise you
about McCallum's list
of key questions for managers?
Or about history in general?
Yeah.
- [Student] It's very applicable to today.
- Isn't it crazy?
The first time I read this
which was about 25 years
ago in grad school,
I really thought this is
odd that somebody who,
remember apprenticed as a woodworker,
no formal training,
didn't educationally
go beyond grade school.
There's no such thing as business school
there's no role models
he had no apprenticeship
he was promoted every 24ish months
into higher and higher levels
of responsibility with no
clue what he was doing.
He basically admits as
much in this letter.
These questions are really useful today.
- [Student] There are no financial
constraints or goals in there.
- Yeah.
It does kind of take for granted
the financial viability of the business
which by the way was not
a good thing to take for granted
because about two or three years
after he wrote this letter,
the railroad failed.
(laughter)
But you know,
we honor that (laughs)
I should say more importantly
than all that stuff you saw--
can you flip it back to
the picture of him?
You see what uniform he's wearing.
He became the master of railroads
for the Union Army, thank God.
Right 'cause if he'd
been in the Confederates
we wouldn't be talking
about Daniel McCallum.
He was on the Union's side,
he played a huge important role
in commandeering the supplies
to feed General Sherman's
attack on Atlanta.
Hero of the Civil War as well as
hero of capitalism.
Yeah these five questions.
No financial milestones or
a preoccupation with finances,
still pretty relevant today.
Anything else jump out at you?
Yeah?
- [Student] He appears pretty enlightened
for I guess working with
quadrennial workers.
- Yeah.
- [Student] He's concerned
with his providence...
- The fact that this is on the list,
now the way he says it
is something to the effect of
execute all of the above so as not to
create embarrassment for the management,
the managers.
That idea of respect was
really totally surprising
and very unique I think for the times.
Yeah?
- [Student] Not only
how applicable they are
but how unsolved they still are
and he wrote this 170 years ago.
- I find it a great relief that
I'm not the only one who doesn't
know how to do any of these things,
or who tries to figure out ways to do it.
This has been going on a long time,
this has happened before,
still unresolved.
Was there somebody had
a hand over here, no?
Anything else before we keep going on?
Okay.
Just to put this in context,
what was McCallum doing?
He was participating in his own
small way right about here
where the shape of this curve was by
no means a foregone conclusion,
in fact they didn't even know
that it was going this way.
They sort of felt like
something was different
but they didn't know
it was going this way.
They certainly didn't know
the amount of wealth that they
were part of creating.
And they certainly didn't know that what
McCallum was doing in a weird way,
was directly tied to that injustice
stuff that I talked to you about before.
This is a book called
Things as they are in America.
A British guy named William Chambers
came to America in the late 1840s,
early 1850s and he wrote a diary
of what he observed in the then
very young country pre-Civil War.
So one of the stops he made was
to see the slave auctions
in Virginia.
And I'm gonna read to you--
this was happening a few hundred miles
to the South of where McCallum
was struggling with these lofty ideas of,
geez, how do we get
people to work together
and how do we make sure that
the work gets done
and how do we make sure that
the right amount of responsibility
is conferred on people?
All those general management challenges
that he laid out in his letter
about the railroad,
a couple hundred miles to the South.
This is Chambers writing about
his visit to Richmond.
Here according to the announcement
on the paper stuck to the flag,
there were to be sold
a woman and three children.
A young woman, three men,
a middle-aged woman and a little boy.
Already a crowd had met,
composed I should think of persons
mostly from the cotton
plantations of the South.
He goes on to describe the situations,
the situation in the room where
the auction was being held.
And he writes,
while intending purchases were
proceeding with personal examinations
of the several lots,
what he means by that is that
the people who came to buy
the other human beings was poking
and prodding them and
looking in their mouth
and checking their hands
to understand how much they
should pay for those people.
I took the liberty of
putting a few questions
to the mother of the children.
The following was our conversation.
Are you married, woman?
Yes sir.
How many children have you had?
Seven.
Where is your husband?
In Madison County.
When did you part from him?
On Wednesday two days ago.
Were you sorry to part from him?
Yes sir, she replied with a deep sigh.
My heart almost abroke.
Why is your master selling you?
I don't know.
He wants money to buy some land.
I suppose he sells me for that.
This cures that.
That's why what you're doing matters.
This would never have happened
without people like McCallum
and the wealth that was created
from that industrial revolution
paid for the destruction of this
disgusting industry.
So that's why it matters.
Oh that's it.
So no pressure,
but civilization depends on you.
And now I'd be happy to have a chat.
- [Voiceover] So in reading McCallum's
letter did you get a sense that he
was a micromanager?
- [Michael] Oh terrible.
- Yeah.
- Terrible, he had
practices not only for those telegraph
rules that I mentioned before,
excruciating detail
about how the telegrams
were to be addressed,
the time table on which they were
supposed to happen,
how you would decide to break a tie
between two trains on the same track,
it was an excruciatingly
detailed operating manual.
- So it might be somewhat
given the education level,
but he was like send me
a telegram every hour,
I can imagine a startup
in Silicon Valley saying
report your status every
hour (laughs) right?
It wouldn't be a great
talent retention strategy.
- No he was flailing around for any tool
he could get his hands on to try
to recreate the intimacy of managing
a small business on a large one
and of course he failed completely.
- Well and the financial one
was a very good question.
It was kind of a question of
well there's other things that go into
doing this although,
before the lecture I
didn't know about McCallum
and he actually may be the very
first example of a systematic attack
on the scale up problem.
So in the book we're working on,
we're going to read the letter
and we're going to see if
we're going to include it
so it's awesome.
So when you look at the curve,
one part of that curve
is obviously capitalism.
- Yes.
- But another part of it's also
invention of technology.
And those two are actually in fact
obviously somewhat correlated
although how deeply is
a little bit unclear.
When you think about this exponential
growth and value how much do you attribute
to the incentive system that essentially
capitalism does to create a decentralized
system of incentives,
and how much technology invention
and how do you look at that curve?
Or that cycle?
- I think of them as mutually reinforcing
and if you took one away
the other would collapse.
And we know that because we accidentally
ran an experiment for
800 years as a planet
where we had lots of smart
people running around
inventing new ways to do things,
you could look at banking in Florence
or printing in England,
but these became very small enterprises.
They sort of topped out at like the 20-30
people range and of course the capital
that accumulated around
those businesses was tiny.
What really unleashed it in my view
was the disconnection of the good ideas
from the money from the management.
So when you had to have one person
who happened to have money,
happened to have great ideas
and happened to have managerial ambitions,
that's a small set of people.
When you suddenly say
ah, the money people can be different
than the inventor and the inventor
can yet be different
than the general manager,
that allows a multitude of connections
that wouldn't have happened otherwise.
- And when you did this kind of learning,
did you also include kind of the weird
paradox of venture capital that was
essentially invented post World War II?
So it's actually very late in that curve.
- It is very late in that curve
and I think what you have to look at
is the substitutes for venture capital
were essentially rich families,
and rich institutions and you can go back
to Slater's Mill,
the people who put the capital
for Slater's Mill.
Oh that's why I had that
damn slide in there.
The people who put up the
capital for Slater's Mill
were the Brown family of Providence,
the people after whom
Brown University was named.
This was a family that made their fortune
in the slave trade and
then the textile business.
And then had no clue how to mechanize
their spinning operations.
Slater was the embodiment of somebody
who had the technical
skill and inventiveness
ideas mostly which he stole from the UK
and they were able to
pair together in a way
that wouldn't have been
possible previously.
In prior generations the Brown family
would have had to have the incredible
good fortune of
understanding the technology
and having the money.
Now all they had to do was be rich
and they were good at that.
- And also by the way the history
of venture capital actually it's all moved
in many of the elite funds to
the institutions you're mentioning.
But actually the starting
of them was actually
also wealthy families.
- Yes.
- By the way it was a
similar kind of thing
that was kind of an interesting
- Absolutely.
- recapitulation of history.
- Yep.
- Alright now shifting somewhat,
we're getting to hone into some of
the scale of stuff but at the very broad.
So it's kind of a call
to arms for capitalism.
It's a call to arms for entrepreneurship
it's a call to arms for
creative construction.
When should someone,
we have a bunch of students here,
when should they consider doing a startup
and when should they not consider
doing a startup and how is some of
the way to think about that?
- Well one of the things I've noticed
over the last about eight years I've been
exclusively focused on
early-stage ventures
is that they kind of
can't keep it inside them.
It kind of bursts out whether it's
a good idea or a bad idea.
The founder has this explosion that
they can't keep inside anymore
and they irrationally allocate time
and resources to this idea because
they can't stop thinking about it.
I think that's a prerequisite
if you're gonna--
so if you smell that about yourself,
if you feel like you can't stop thinking
or working on an idea,
if you find that you're working on an idea
and the hands of the clock move
and you never even noticed that
the sun went down and
you missed two meals,
that's a really good sign
that you have an idea
you have to get out of your system.
The other characteristics I think
of the folks when they know they're ready
is that they are accidentally,
not even trying to recruit other people,
but accidentally getting their friends
fired up too.
And so the friends come
and start saying like,
hey remember that thing you
told me about last week,
I was thinking about it a little bit more.
I'm not like a mystical person,
but I kind of think the
market talks to you,
that's the market talking to you,
that's the market saying tell me more,
I'm pulling on you for more insight.
If you have those circumstances going on
those are good indicators it's time
to do something about it.
- And what are the
indicators you would use
for checking the idea.
Because obviously you could have those
indicators you could be crazy about them.
- Yes.
- You could be jumping off a cliff with no
ability to assemble an airplane
on the way down.
- Right.
- What are the crosschecks you
think people should do?
- One really good one is to give
a chunk of time in the schedule
to devil's advocacy.
And this was a tactic that I learned
from Michael Eisner at Disney.
I didn't work for him but I worked for
somebody who worked for him
and the whole idea there was
every big good idea is going to be
subjected to a devil's advocate case.
And somebody probably the smartest
person he could find is going to be
in charge of trying to destroy your idea.
And he or she isn't
gonna be held as like--
they're not going to be considered to be
out of bounds for trying
to destroy your idea
it was their job to try
to destroy your idea.
And that technique of saying
okay you please spend the next two days
finding everything wrong with this,
and then you have full permission
to be the biggest asshole you ever met,
trying to torpedo this idea.
If you can find some people in your life
who can play that role,
that's a huge positive as a founder.
I think the other technique that I like
to do with founders is
let's do a pre-mortem.
Let's admit now that we failed.
And let's forecast what it is that would
have gone wrong to cause our death.
And if we can do that openly and honestly
and make a list of what
those deadly risks are
facing us in our venture,
we may decide to bail we may decide
to keep going,
but we can't keep going without
building shock absorbers for those risks.
- Love the two ideas,
the version of the first one is
when you talk to every
smart person you know
and you should specifically ask them
what's wrong on the idea.
Because the problem when
you're talking to them
I go to my friend Michael and say
what do you think of my idea?
They'll be like oh he wants reassurance,
so oh it's great.
- Yeah.
- You should do that.
That's terrible that should be
negative value not positive.
But what's broken?
I think I already called
John out on telling
me that LinkedIn was a totally bad idea.
(indistinct speaking from audience member)
- Yes that's true that's
a very good point.
- People need that by the way,
people need that permission from you
as a founder.
For you to give them permission to say
I want you to be negative now
I don't even care if you believe it
but give me your best shot.
That social permission,
especially in an area that's so happy
smiles and rainbows as
I was gonna say Silicon Valley
but Stanford's that way too,
in a good way.
Let's have a little bit of shock absorber
against the rainbows.
- And actually specifically part of
the thing that John's feedback was
very good on is that you can't
build to enough critical mass
and so that helped confirm
the strategic thing was
the very first thing
at LinkedIn was to
build the critical mass.
Because when you get to good feedback,
it doesn't necessarily die,
but they say ooh this is the mine.
Make it past this mine because
smart people going this is the mine
you're like pay attention to that.
Make sure you understand that
and that became the very top list thing
that Allen and I and a
bunch of other people
were working on on a daily basis.
Last thing in terms of founding a startup
or at least this part of it,
what role do you think
considering competition
should be on whether or not you have
a good idea or not?
- A lot of times the founders who
pause on the issue of competition,
they pause for the wrong reasons
and they say things like,
well isn't big company
XYZ going to do something
just like this?
That's totally irrelevant.
That's totally irrelevant.
The perfectly competitive product
that promises what your product promises
is almost never the actual competition.
The competition is almost always
the substitute for buying your thing
is doing nothing where hacking their
solution in their daily life,
the user I'm talking about
and so I think if you're
a friend of a founder
or a founder yourself,
steer the conversation more like
wait a minute I should not worry about
big companies because they're slow
and usually bad but I
should be worried about
what's occupying my
target user's attention
today because that's really what I'm
competing against.
If you can answer that question,
that's a lot more valuable
than a competitive
matrix that like a
consulting firm would do.
- Actually frequently that one I'd say
to scout the large company as competition
unless like you're doing a search.
- (laughs)
- Or unless you're doing marketplace for
you is good.
And it's eBay.
'Cause then you gotta understand,
but discount otherwise.
Do think about other startups,
right because sometimes like a startup man
should have a better approach on
the market than you
and then that actually
is a relevant variable.
It's not to say you should pattern your
strategy on them,
- Yeah.
- But you should be on
the consideration side.
So actually given that one
of the more funny things,
given your presentation
what would be your advice
for eBay now that you're years past,
how would you reinvent?
- Well you've got to keep
in mind I've been gone
longer than I was ever there.
So I've been gone for almost 10 years,
but I do of course watch it.
My advice is do more of
what they've been doing,
which is this unbundling of PayPal
was I think the right thing.
I think it was the right
thing for shareholders,
it was the right thing for employees
and the users to create
more of a competitive
market for the ideas.
One of the nice things
about the combination
of lots of complementary assets is you
can do command and control economy inside,
you can allocate capital
by the decision of the CEO.
And what happens over time is his or her
judgement is fallible and the market
is actually a much better
allocator of capital
than one CEO or one investment committee
inside a large company.
I like the unbundling,
I would encourage them to think about
doing more of it.
I certainly would also think about
the amount of people that work there.
It sure feels like a lot.
And I'm not advocating for layouts,
although I guess maybe I just did.
(laughter)
- You're advocating for
asking the questions.
- Yes.
- Funny, I actually don't
know your view on this.
Some of the leading edge
Silicon Valley people
think that you should organize internal
companies based on markets versus
command and control.
Do you have that point of view,
if so why if not why not?
- I do particularly
with respect to product
development resources and I tried
a handful of times where I've actually had
management responsibility for
a product process allocating software
and hardware development time,
which is the scarcest,
much more scarce than capital.
Two particular projects tried to create
a competitive market internal to
the firms so that there was vigorous
and in some cases maybe even negative
productivity but the competition
for resources was very intense.
And the internal mechanisms for drawing
the line were driven by the economic value
of the idea rather than the whim
of a particular senior executive.
- [Reid] But how did
you make the decisioning
happening because the decisioning,
is it voting what was
the proxy for the market?
- Net present value,
we would do--
- But that's models, right?
- It is so you have to have faith that
people are not padding the models
you have to have devil's advocates
tear apart the models,
it becomes quite a bit of overhead,
but if people are held accountable
to economic evaluation of their ideas,
over time you can start to get a pattern,
you can recognize a pattern
whether people are good
predictors of their own
economic value of their ideas
and then allocate the resources
on the basis of the highest
NPV projects on the list.
The downside to this is of course
that you feed the beast,
the mothership business because
the NPV the Net Present Value
of assigning more resources to
the highly profitable
already huge businesses
is unbeatable really in an internal market
and that's why these big companies end up
being slaves to their core business
and they can't beat you,
they can't beat you on
innovation or speed.
- And would you recommend that
a startup implement the marketplace
mechanism in the beginning,
yes or no?
- Yes but with a different pricing model.
I don't think startups
should have to go through
the rigorous pricing
and valuation analysis
that a large company should.
I think that ultimately the founder has
to be the guardian and the editor-in-chief
of that product roadmap and she or he
has to say here's where we're drawing
the line and here's why.
Everybody can submit an idea,
everybody can make their case
and I'm gonna listen to everything
but it's a benevolent dictatorship
on the product side.
- Interestingly I think I
disagree with you there.
I actually think the frequent thing
that characterizes the startup phase is
we are all casting our
lot in this one direction.
Actually in fact having somebody who is
an autocrat or a small
number of people who
are autocrats in doing it.
For the efficiency of focus on doing that
is actually in fact a
key part of the success
but I do think it's
interesting that as you get
to the higher levels in
order of a magnitude scale,
there's a fork in the road that happens
there that's actually super interesting,
who do you think is the most successful
company that implements
a marketplace internal mechanism for this?
- Hmm.
I've been very impressed with how Airbnb
allocates resources for
product development.
And I say that because I think their--
I think, and this is an
outsider's point of view
I don't have any special
insight knowledge,
but the people I know who work there
often talk about like
the things they need to invest in today
for how the user experience needs to be
9, 12, 24 months from now.
And so I think they have
a perspective on managing the portfolio
of investments it's pretty evolved
and very effective it seems.
I also think that they're very
economically driven I think they do
the math on these
investments that they make.
Now Airbnb is not what you might call
a startup anymore,
but it is an early stage company in
the spectrum of companies
that decades long
that are big companies
that are decades old.
I think smaller companies,
there's a company that
I work with right now
called Signal Sciences which is 10 people
in the app security market
and Signal Sciences has product
about as wide open a
funnel as you can imagine
on the front end of the process
and the founders do sit
at the center of that
and they listen into every idea
no matter how far off, wacky, in line
with the strategy
and then they cull it
and then they have an honest conversation
about why we're building
what we're building.
So it's kind of a hybrid of like wide open
chaotic market on the front end
but benevolent dictatorship
when it comes to writing stuff
on the roadmap.
- In that case probably benevolent
sometimes benevolent sometimes not
it all depends.
(laughing)
So shifting.
There's kind of a mainstream view now
that contrarian is being important.
So it's a very common or a consensus
view that contrarian isn't important.
Do you think contrarianism is important
in a startup idea,
if so how and if not kinda why not?
Is it critical to be contrarian?
- I don't think it's imperative,
I do think it's a nice
feature of a startup.
I think it's certainly the place where
you find value as an investor
because of course it's the wild enthusiasm
of conventional wisdom that chases
prices higher in those investment rounds.
I appreciate contrarian thinking
in a founder from that perspective.
I more enjoy the contrarian point of view
because it helps me understand how
the founder's brain works
and his or her road map
from technical insight
to the product idea that they have.
If it's totally surprising,
there's a lot of interesting stuff
happening in there.
I like it more from what it tells me about
the founder's thinking process.
- I actually think that to get a massive
discontinuous result in something,
that usually has to be contrarian
at least at the time
of founding and going.
Because otherwise we have a lot
of different entrepreneurs,
a lot of different efforts,
the actual limiter factors,
a lot of people competing for
the same capital talent, market space,
customers, et cetera.
On the other hand I actually think
part of where the whole contrarian theory
goes too far is actually in fact
you can have something that is maybe
specifically contrarian
like take work day.
Which said okay, people didn't believe
that going to the cloud was important
so it made that key contrarian decision,
but actually that next generation
of high quality HR software said
well this is much easier to use
much better it has the benefit of
like it made one key contrarian decision
but everything else was
just very good execution.
Because it's not contrarian to say
I have a much better UI.
Or it's not contrarian,
you know like those kinds of things.
And so it's a new onset that
I think is actually important.
Okay shifting to some of the kind of
more what you think of is
kind of how we do startups questions.
How do you think people should think
about evaluating themselves as founders?
Like when they think,
am I a good founder or not,
should I do this or not?
Part of it is having the passion
that you mentioned before.
But part of it is also other attributes.
What are the things that you think
people should consider
in their self evaluation?
- I think there's two
separate answers to that.
Let me do one which is really simple,
and one's a lot more complicated.
The simple one is that the stages
of life you'll go through
as a founder.
First you have to have an insight,
a technical insight.
Second you have to turn
that insight into a product,
and third you have to hopefully,
God willing turn that
product into a business.
Those are about as different sets
of pursuits with very little
in common with each other.
And so if you are energized by the idea
of coming up with a technical insight
and then moving to productization
and then moving to the
business building phase,
that journey will be satisfying
and exciting to you.
If you find yourself totally in love
with the technical insight
manufacturing process,
that is a real problem.
And then you end up
having science projects,
not companies.
If you find yourself endlessly
prototyping and tinkering with the product
without regard to the business economics,
then that's a warning flag as well.
I think you have to be energized,
in today's market where the expectation
is that if you're onto something,
you're not just moving from these stages,
you are screaming across those stages.
You have to be willing
in the earliest days
to see yourself as
okay we're in technical insight mode,
in a month we're gonna be productizing,
we're gonna be worried about business
economics shortly thereafter.
- [Reid] And after we get
to the other nuances of this
I'll actually add a few things but how do
you find co-founders,
how should you select co-founders?
- The advice I normally give people
is take inventory of your own brain.
There's a video on my website on
Harrisonmetal.com called the Cognitive
Distortions of Founders.
And this is an inventory of the five
most common wacky ways of seeing
the world that I've
observed across thousands
of founders that I've talked to over
the last decade.
The founders if they have an idea,
let's say I'll pick on one which is
a black and white thinker.
Somebody who's very judgmental
about people and products,
they form very quick opinions
and they are very strongly held.
The black or white thinker often times
needs to be paired or shock absorbed
by somebody who can point to
the gray or the nuance or say
I like this thread of it but what about
this idea over here
so that the other people in the team don't
get shut down by the visionary
black and white thinker.
So I think of it like pairing
your deadly risk with
great shock absorbers.
And just acknowledging that you've got
deadly risks that are the flip side
of your great strengths is a huge step
in the right direction
and that pairing the co-founders
is probably the most powerful way
to shock absorb.
And ideally you're even
shock absorbing each other.
- And actually since you mentioned that
one of our students'
questions and apologies
if I get the name
exactly right or wrong on
the pronunciation Nihit Desai asked
as an investor what kinds
of cognitive resources
do any of you look for
in founders and how?
- Well the ones that I really zoom in on
is first a sense of
personal exceptionalism
a sense about themselves that,
you know some countries
have this about themselves,
this is a sense that you're not destined
for an average outcome in life,
that you're somehow operating outside
the boundaries normal for your peer group.
That sense of personal exceptionalism
comes in very handy when you're
founding a company.
The black and white thinking one
is a real example,
I think that's an important skill.
For me it proxies for the
speed of decision making,
I don't actually like
black and white thinking
because the error rate can be high,
but I do like the speed part of it,
and speed is almost all
you have in those days.
Another one is very related
to Joseph Schumpeter
who we talked about earlier,
a Schumpetering mindset which is
no matter the pain the creative part
of Creative Destruction is what gets me up
in the morning so I am so excited
about building the new thing that I will
put myself and others through
the torture of the destruction.
There are a couple others in that list.
Let's see...
- [Reid] Go to the website.
- Okay yeah go to the website.
- And we'll post it.
- Okay.
- So one of the things I
would add to what you said
is you've got to think about in addition
to the whole passion product
kind of company as and are.
You have to think a little bit about,
do we have the key foundational skill sets
that can actually tackle this market?
It's anything from can
we build the product
to can we go to market,
and how do we acquire those?
The ones that are in the founding team
have to be without this we shouldn't
even try this product.
Obviously there will be a lot of skills
that you acquire through hiring
and we'll get to that in a second.
So you have to think about that
as I think as kind of a cross check.
And then I actually think that part
of what you have to think about is
part of the role of
founders different from
people you're hiring is being generalists.
Tackling any problem
that kind of comes along
and that flexibility because there's just
a laundry list of unexpected pivots,
you know and challenges that you're
not anticipating that one or more
of the initial team is gonna have to go
jump on so one of the things that we think
starts very heavily in
this phase is generalist.
And you get to more hiring a specialist
as your scale.
Those are the kind of things to think
about adding to this.
- [Student] Actually
Michael was saying earlier
about you go from technology or product
to modernization you
really love technology,
too bad you can't do it.
It's one of the things about good patterns
is you're drawn to follow
everybody else on your team.
You have to look unique because nobody
else will do that.
- Exactly.
So let's talk also about
the first few hires.
Like how do you hire well,
you've got ideally ideal teams of
two or three sometimes it's solo
sometimes it's five,
two or three is usually
the ideal founding team.
Now you make your first three hires
your first five hires.
How do you advise the very startups
you work with what kind of hiring process
to run what to do what not to do?
- Well I get very worried when I see
people come with a shopping list.
And they're saying okay,
I need 32 ounces of front end developer,
and I need a pound of IOS backend.
It just doesn't work that way
and I think the early
stage should be about
surrounding yourself with people
who share your passion but who also
will pick up and do anything.
And of course there's
a checklist of things
they have to be able to do,
but I think of it like I look back at
the successful early hiring experiences
versus the unsuccessful ones,
the shopping listers almost always
a red flag on there's
something gonna be wrong here.
And the most successful hires I think
in the early days come from your network
or one degree separated from your network.
And that's because the passion has been
transmitted in an organic way,
not through a recruiter
or a third party or an ad.
I think that has its place,
but it's much later in the cycle.
Those first few I think you probably
already know them.
- [Reid] Yeah and I
actually agree with that.
Not just because the signal,
but also because of a bunch
of other characteristics like
are they gonna go through
the valley of shadows with you
cause you're almost always there.
Are they actually in fact committed to
we're gonna get this ship to port?
Are they for example things that are
very difficult to measure,
even in reference checking
which is obviously critically important.
I always prefer reference checking to
interviewing if I had to pick one.
But questions like for example,
how much in general learners are there,
how much generalists are there,
how much can they pick up something new
that you don't expect?
You get all that much
more through your network.
- I also think that these conversations
have to be focused on tell me about
a time when you fill in the blank.
Tell me about a time when you faced
like a horrible disappointment,
tell me about a time you consider
your greatest victory.
Tell me about a time when you realized
you were different.
You know go back and talk to people
about their lives.
People repeat the same strengths
and weaknesses over and over again
and all you have to do
is ask for a few stories
and you'll get a very good view into
who they actually are.
- Like solving key problems.
- Solving key problem,
what did you decide to
do with your free time,
when you had your summers to yourself
or when you had an open space
in your course calendar,
or you had three months to go do
whatever you wanted between gigs,
what did you do when
you had perfect freedom?
- The students are probably having
a little bit of deja vu,
some questions like this were
on our application process.
- Oh is that right good, good, good.
- And there's a reason for that,
by the way which you were revealing.
So now you've got your founders together,
you may have hired a
few people you're going.
What are the first
things that you focus on?
- Well it goes back to that McCallum list,
I mean that is,
I walk around with that thing.
It comes up every single day for me
with founders as you know,
who's working on what,
is that the most important stuff?
Do they have the authority
to keep moving ahead
or are they blocked by something?
How do we know how it's
going along the way?
You'd be amazed how many ten person
companies get surprised
at the end of a release
or a roll out or a month,
they'll be like oh well that didn't work.
Well how can that be,
we're sitting right here
how can we you know.
So those McCallum questions
that he was really
trying to say,
look running the 50 mile road is a joy
and easy compared to this
nightmare that I'm in.
Here's the things that I
know are the fundamental
duties of the leader.
And that's I think just as true today
in startups as it was for McCallum.
- [Reid] Is there a question you would
add to McCallum's list if you were
to have a seventh?
- For early stage
ventures I probably would
go back to the question
about financial viability.
Are we sure that we're
building a business?
And unfortunately in the
current funding environment,
many things are being
backed with venture capital
that are not in fact
going to be businesses.
They're either public goods,
science projects or hobbies.
But they're not businesses and so I think
that's a discipline that I would
add to the McCallum list.
- [Reid] Hobbies is a very gentle word.
What is the importance and when of having
a go to market and distribution strategy?
- I think that you have to
have a hypothesis of it.
And I know that it's very
unfashionable to have
the idea of a full detailed
plan on founding day
is not what's going to happen.
But I do like to know how the founders
think about that because it helps
me understand how their brain works.
So I think of it like
an opinionated person
who has the guts to found a company
ought to have some hypothesis about
how it might go to market.
- [Reid] Would your decision to invest
ever gate on that?
- Yes because if it doesn't exist,
it's a laziness of mind
and a red flag.
Now I think you have to distinguish
is there a prototype
answer to that question
versus how close to awesome is that
prototype answer?
It doesn't need to be awesome because
we're gonna have many, many cycles
to figure that out.
But there has to be a prototype.
You can't convince a
stranger to give you money.
You shouldn't be able
to convince a stranger
to give you money if you haven't said,
and here by the way is
how we will go to market.
You could be completely wrong
but you can't withhold
that view into your brain.
It's like saying I don't
have a prototype yet
of the actual software,
you'd never say that.
- So I'm going to give you a brief list
of things that are my suggestions
but you can mod them and comment.
I want you to actually specifically
comment on them.
What are the things you can ignore?
What are the things you
go at the early stage
don't pay any attention to this,
or do minimally or do intensively?
A board of directors, hiring executives,
knowledge about advertising campaigns,
planning your brand, applying for scale
in customer service,
detailed analytic dashboards.
- These are all on the list of things
you can safely ignore.
- [Reid] Mostly.
Not always there's always specifics.
- I would say every founder should have
his or her own list of
things they plan to ignore.
And they should also
know that if I'm going
to ignore board of directors,
I need to have a governance approach,
I need to make sure that somebody
is looking at this who isn't just me.
Who can critique the strategy
it might be an advisor it might be
a trusted colleague it
might be a cofounder
who has the--
- [Reid] We're only
talking about 5-15 people
kind of in the company this is this phase.
- Well and the reason
I'm zooming in on board
is because most of the companies I fund
are that size and I always put a board on
and I'm always on it.
So I think they serve a really good
and valuable function
and if you're gonna do
without one of these
things you should just have
a hypothesis or a shock absorber in its
place to do that function.
One of the things I wish was on your list,
and maybe it is further
down is freakin' PR.
And the idea that founders are brands
and that companies need
to have high profile
and be written about by whomever is a lie.
It's a complete and total lie.
And it's manufactured by the people
who sell ads for page views to convince
you that you need to talk to them.
And it's a complete and total lie.
You may decide for your own reasons
to go do PR for your company,
but it doesn't actually
change the outcome.
In fact many times it can actually tip
the outcome in the wrong direction,
and recruiting is a
perfect example of this.
If you are deciding to do
PR because of recruiting,
the people you'll attract
are the wrong people.
Because most of your life as a company
will be spent not being written about in
a flattering way.
And so if that's what
they need to be motivated,
then they're going to
be very disappointed.
- By the way as a pointer here,
in the first class we
mentioned that one of
the things you'll see
is we go through each
of these stages between these very smart
people doing this.
If some things will be
reiterated they're kind
of surprising and those are the things
to actually pay attention to,
and some things we'll obviously disagree
and that's fine.
This was one of the points
that Sam was making,
Sam Altman was making
them in the last class.
That actually in fact
is a reiteration point.
And that was part of
the reason that I'd kind
of point out what the
patterns of surprising
similarity would be.
On the board of directors,
what I more mean is actually in fact
if you find a financial partner,
co-investor you should
actually get someone
who is maximally adding value.
The normal position is for them
to partner with you by board of directors
so I actually agree with
you just to be clear there.
However sometimes I see a founders way,
okay how do I build out my board?
Like how do I have
independence now et cetera.
At the 5-15 people...
- No.
- [Student] If it wasn't
the other way around
why do you need a board of 5-15
just build products...
maybe you could talk a little bit more
about what you mean (indistinct)
- I think it's the healthy accountability
to the market.
Which you have to remember,
if you've got no customers
and you've got no product,
but you've got a pile of money
provided by those awesome institutions
it's a citizenship duty
to actually sit down
and say here's where we're gonna spend it,
here's how long it's gonna last us.
Is there anything we should be doing
differently in your opinion?
You can get that a lot of ways,
I like it with a board just because
I think it gives people in the seed stage
it gives them a dress
rehearsal of what it's
gonna be like when they are dealing with
Sand Hill Road people.
- I don't really like to be identified
as a Sand Hill road
person but that's okay.
- You know what I mean,
you know what I mean.
(laughter)
- [Student] Reid's a
loser nobody's denying it.
- Yes.
- It's fine.
- I live in denial.
- You get to name yourself Reid.
- I try.
(laughter)
- Yeah so I think of it
like a dress rehearsal
for varsity level company management.
- [Reid] Well since we're
on this part of financing,
what recommendation do you give
just founding teams,
the founders, the first couple people
in terms of how to think about financing?
What are the key dos and don'ts?
And obviously the backdrop is
everyone's reflex is simply go for
the highest valuation and the highest
amount of money because it looks
like a scorecard.
- Well it's even worse that that because
the conventionalism today says
punt totally on valuation.
And use convertible debt,
or even worse something called
a simple agreement for future equity
which God knows what that is.
(laughter)
You know I think--
- [Reid] Schumpeter
probably wouldn't have--
- No listen nobody came to this country
because they wanted to have great
convertible debt terms.
People thrive in this environment
because they want ownership,
they want to add value to their ownership
and then they want to sell their ownership
later for more.
And along the way they're gonna create
hopefully a fortune that will do
good things for the world.
We kind of can't help ourselves
when we make a fortune.
As a species we do good
things with the money.
Even the worst people you can imagine,
when they drop dead that money is going
to go to really good use.
I think this is an ownership economy,
and I'd like to be part
of an ownership economy.
I encourage founders,
treat yourself to real shareholders.
Real shareholders.
People who rise and sink with you.
People who do not have a particularly
special downside protection.
People who do not have a lender's claim
on your assets.
This is all nonsense created by
the legal profession
and some I don't even
know what to call them,
hucksters who want to explode
the size of the venture capital business.
- [Reid] Corporate capital from your
earlier description.
- Something.
It's a terrible disservice
to teach founders
that they don't deserve shareholders
who rise and fall with them,
who don't sink and swim with them.
Who aren't tied to the mast with them.
And that unfortunately is,
you do not get that when you sell
convertible debt or when you have
highly distributed financings from people
who for you it's like a generous tip
that they gave you,
it's not even really skin in the game.
So treat yourself to shareholders
have the hard conversation
about valuation.
It's perfectly okay to
disagree with somebody
about the valuation of your company.
By the way the math to do evaluation
on an early stage
company is really simple.
How big a check do you want to write,
divided by what ownership percentage
do you want to have.
If you can do that,
and I know you all can
because I could do it in fifth grade,
you can value a company.
That's all it is.
So ignore the advice you're getting
from lawyers or whomever
to do convertible debt with no valuation.
It's a terrible poison in
our industry right now.
- [Student] Do you think
the same thing about
convertible notes with caps?
- Yes even worse.
They're disguised as...
Lipstick on a pig is that the right thing?
- [Reid] That is an idiom.
It's still not ownership,
and by the way that cap is never
the today value of the company
so what you're asking the investor to do,
and you would never do this
because you're smart,
you're in the front row of this class.
(laughter)
You would never take the deal where I said
okay I'm gonna ask you to help me
on a bunch of stuff and then I'm going
to give you shares valued at the price
after you're done helping me.
That's a terrible deal.
Why should you pay for value
that you helped create?
Why should you not benefit from the upside
that you get from taking that venture risk
at the beginning of the venture?
You should get a price that reflects
the value today,
not the hypothetical value 12 months
down the road.
Does that make sense?
No?
- And actually I will take these questions
in a second because this
is an important issue,
the key way to look at this is
if you are actually
selecting a good partner
in building this business,
you want someone who is motivated
by trying to magnify the value
of your business as much as possible.
You want to give them actually a stake
at where your valuation is
and then you come to an agreement
that actually is a good process
it's one of the few
things in entrepreneurship
with zero sum it's what percentage.
Because it's a zero sum negotiation.
But the way you navigate that zero sum
conversation is actually
in fact very helpful
for understanding how good partners
you're gonna be in the future.
It's a good test on both sides,
because it's a difficult
thing to navigate.
But once you navigate that,
you've solved that problem
and then you've given your partner
an incentive.
The how do you grow the business
as much as possible.
And so that's reason why uncapped
convertible debts are a terrible idea.
Right like just horrible.
And almost never do them,
personally other than like
minimum checks that say sure fine,
it doesn't really mean anything.
But I almost never do them.
Cap is still a problem because you should
do exactly what Michael is talking about.
Sometimes cap is a hack that you know,
that is more acceptable for that reason.
Now we have two questions.
One was here.
- [Student] So as a founder if you're
trying to raise money and you have options
to take money from like in the form of
a convertible note with
a cap or without a cap,
I think part of my understanding
of your criticism is
it seems like an unfair
deal on the financier's side.
Because you're helping grow valuation
of a company without
getting a piece of that.
But as a founder if you're raising
in competitive fundraising like right now
where it's much easier to
raise money than historically,
if you still think that
you're gonna be getting
like the valuable
benefits of a partnership
and because of the competitive nature
of the seed right now,
some are willing to give you like
a capped convertible note
that inflates your valuation.
How much of that is important versus
working with a partner who will provide
like this beyond.
And obviously from your perspective
as people who are providing.
- We're teachers in this context,
not venture capitalists.
- Well and the other thing we are
is we vote with our dollars right?
And so if an investor
is willing to do that
deal that you said,
a capped convertible note
and she or he is saying
I will help you just the same as I would
with straight up equity.
You have to just ask
yourself if you believe it.
I'd say about 60% of the meetings I have
on a weekly basis with founders
are people I don't even have a business
relationship with,
they're just people who say like,
hey can we talk because I need help?
The number of those founders who are
showing me polluted cap tables
with useless investors who do nothing,
who promise the world who said
my rolodex is your rolodex,
if you're in trouble call me.
The phone's ringing,
shit's hitting the fan
nobody's picking up.
That doesn't happen.
That just doesn't happen when somebody
is going to lose a lot of money
and a lot of ownership in the business.
It just doesn't.
I think that you have to ask yourself
if the idea of equity was invented
after thousands of years of people
trading with each other
and learning how the human
operating system works.
And there's a reason why some people
like to be owners.
It's so they can help and they can make
it worth more money,
not because they're altruistic,
but because they're highly motivated
to put points on the board financially.
And so to ask that,
to believe that the human operating system
isn't what we for thousands of years
it seems like it is,
is really a stretch.
And I'm seeing lots of
founders who are just,
they're looking at their list of 30-40
investors each of whom have put
$25,000 or $50,000 or $100,000 in
and they just can't get any help
because it was a lie from the beginning.
- Two amplifications I would do is one is
at every single financing we did
in LinkedIn we did not actually take
the maximum value.
We actually in fact made choices based
on who we were partnering with
in terms of the offer.
Because it was very much on partner.
And then the second thing is,
I personally and a bunch of investors
have passed on deals because the cap table
is too screwed up.
Because that means it's likely
to screw up the company on the road
because we're investing at
a five to ten year horizon,
so we're looking at patterns
that actually in fact
will trip you up and
that's actually in fact
a serious problem.
So on this topic,
there was another question back here?
- [Student] So there's some lawyers that
are clear value.
- Yes.
- [Student] And you've
learned any capital.
So you should reference this for sure.
- [Student] (unclear speaking)
I guess the idea of the
safe sheet has really
started to bring these issues up again.
Other sheet that people didn't use are the
Fenwick Series C Docs.
It's more of the middle load.
Would you advocate for that?
- That's exclusively what
I use in my business.
Exclusively.
- Just in case it didn't
get on the microphone
it's the Fenwick Series
- Yeah seriesc.com is
a set of open source,
it's also on GitHub.
Series of open source equity financing
documents created by Ted Wang
at Fenwick and West.
And it's the only template I use.
- [Student] Jason Bateman
put that on GitHub.
Who's the partner when you guys
were starting out,
who's the firm that picked up the
phone the most?
- Good question.
- What do you mean by that?
- [Student] I'm not sure
shit ever hit the fan,
but when it did who picked up your phone?
- So I did my series A with Mark Kvamme
who was then at Sequoia
and series B with David Zee who's
at Graylock.
And I put a number of angels into
the series A as well because part of
the thing was a network distribution
and basically nobody got
into that round at all
unless they were actually in fact active.
Either one.
And all of the top tier funds,
all of them have an active
participation model.
There isn't a top tier fund that doesn't
have an active participation model
because that's the thing that actually
helps build truly great companies.
For example one of our mutual friends
is a guy named Josh Kopelman
at First Round Capital,
he was an angel investor at LinkedIn
and he helped.
But that was before
actually I think he had done
First Round Capital.
And those are the kind of things.
But that's actually when you're actually
asking for like you should reference check
as John says but when you're actually
asking people to participate,
you should have explicit conversation
about what this alliance looks like.
Like what is the thing
that we are doing together
and what should I expect
and how should it be.
And the person should be straight up
and you should call them if they're
not holding to what they agreed to.
Is there another question back here?
- [Student] Yeah I wanna understand better
why you like safe documents compared
to the C documents they get rid of
the convertible that
which I think is great
to get rid of that.
- So more elaboration on
what the safe documents are.
- Well I'm deeply suspicious of anything
that's acronym is designed
to make you trust it.
(laughter)
The Patriot Act comes to my mind.
I also don't know what
problem it's solving.
I'm watching a very well-developed
advanced system in capitalism
where I give you money in exchange
for a small piece of
ownership in your company.
It's not a complicated idea,
the math behind it is totally simple.
- [Student] Safe works the same way,
I'm talking about a cap save of course.
- But I'm not a shareholder.
- [Student] (unclear response)
- Heck yeah I have those freakin'
certificates framed behind my desk.
The ownership point,
look at the difference
between renters and owners
and how they treat their homes.
Look at the difference
between rent controlled
situations and ownership societies.
Ownership mechanisms ensure
the best long term custodianship
of those assets.
And we may not like some of the complexity
that goes with that like the difficult
conversation around well how much
are you worth today?
(student speaking in background)
Oh I'm not yelling at you.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
But you know what I'm saying is
it's just a choice.
- [Student] But also the safes don't
fix the price safes work
just like (inaudible)
- Yeah well I don't know,
what is that then?
- [Reid] Very last
question for the session.
- [Student] So you mentioned that it's not
in an customer's best interest to do
a highly distributed deal
and also that you want to have ownership,
a stake that gives you ownership.
From the investor's standpoint what is
the ideal situation (unclear).
- Well I was gonna say
that's a Reid question.
- So I think your ideal circumstance is
you'll actually end up
with two components.
One component is a lead investor
who is literally getting into the foxhole
with you who is gonna be with you through,
cause you're gonna have difficult times,
especially from this you know,
essentially the family's side startup.
You'll have multiple times looking forward
in the future where you're like
why did we ever think
this was a good idea,
why did we ever think this was
gonna succeed?
You want someone who's gonna
work through those problems with you.
And your lead is really important.
The lead is also important as having
a good partnership with you,
being able to help you navigate some
of the challenges,
being able to help you do your next round
of financing because that's usually
the key is the lead is the person
who's gonna help do that.
And you have to think
about not just the upside
circumstances but the down circumstances.
You have to think I might be hitting it
out of the park,
I might be doing okay
and I might be in trouble
and I want a good partner in all
of these circumstances.
They might be particularly good
at one of them
but they'll be good at all of them.
Then the question is what's the percentage
that motivates them?
Most funds that's 20-30%
there are circumstances
where they can trade
below that but those circumstances
usually are like I'd come and my product's
already launched I've
got massive traction,
okay I can be motivated a lower percentage
because I know I'm already
at a higher risk thing.
I've got an idea,
it's the back of a napkin it's like
look if I'm gonna put the
work into this with you
and I'm gonna allocate the time
and try to make it happen,
what's the appropriate percentage?
And usually a way of looking at that is
kind of it's like a financial cofounder
to your percentage.
It's like I'm partnering
with you doing this.
But then you also want to get some people
in the network in terms of
who are key other like angel investors,
key people who can help
with this business,
bring customers, bring talent,
bring advice, solve key problems.
It's a data business,
do you have a great data person
who might be an angel investor
who could help with that.
And it's specific to the business.
And your ideal configuration
is that lead plus a select few of highly
valuable people that you can essentially
partner with and that's
your ideal circumstance.
So there were a set of very good questions
in the LinkedIn group,
we will give some props to you,
we actually noticed them
I actually have them all printed up here.
And so thank you for them.
But I actually thought the financing
thing is so critical during the family one
that I actually in fact
it was worth actually
going in depth on that
and that's part of the
reason I diverted that.
- And if it's helpful I'm happy to
maybe write up some of the answers
to the other questions.
- Yeah I'll send them to you.
- And so with this,
thank Michael for joining us.
(applause)
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much.
