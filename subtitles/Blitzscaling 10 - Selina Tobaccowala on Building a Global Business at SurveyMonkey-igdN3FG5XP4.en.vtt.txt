- Selina was a co-founder
of a site called Evite,
which those of us who are a little older
probably perfectly remember.
- [Voiceover] People still use it!
- [Selina] Probably not gone.
- Yes, exactly.
And then, helped grow
Ticketmaster City Search,
and has been a fundamental
agent of SurveyMonkey,
which is very well-known
within the Silicon Valley community
as being one of the interesting unicorns,
and not as much generally, other than,
most people take them, a survey,
and expose the survey or not.
And so, we thought there were a bunch
of different things that were intersting
about both Selina and the
SurveyMonkey's stories.
So we thought this would be a perfect time
for kind this village
inflection set of choices,
because one of the things that happens is,
when you actually think about
these things that are articulated
as rules in Silicon Valley,
actually, most of these
things are patterns.
Most of these things are heuristics,
and actually in fact sometimes
that specific break of the pattern,
that specific break of a heuristic
is the thing that actually
in fact makes an opportunity
for a unicorn company.
And so, and to that was
one of the things that we,
when we were conspiring.
And so, why don't we kick it off with,
tell us about how SurveyMonkey
does before your time,
was founded, what the early story
of SurveyMonkey is.
- So, SurveyMonkey has
a pretty interesting
and unique start-up story in the sense
that it was one guy, his
name was Ryan Finley,
and he worked at a radio station,
and the radio station said to him,
"Hey, we want to get
feedback from our listeners,"
and he thought, "Oh, wait, I can do this!"
And he learned to code
and he built out the
survey fro the listeners.
And as he did that, he
realized that there was
this opportunity beyond
just the single use case.
And so he built SurveyMonkey on the side
while sill working at the radio station
and eventually it obviously started.
But right away, sorry, one
of the interesting things
is right away it was a
freemium-based business,
before the word "freemium"
was actually existing.
And if you'd think about it, it was 1999,
it was probably, he was
one of the earliest,
if not the earliest models
of, build a product for free,
and then let people upgrade
for paying features.
And that is how he started from day one.
And eventually this product
started making enough money,
and he had what he called
the email bankruptcy,
where all his customers were emailing him,
and he looked at all the customer support,
he couldn't answer everything.
And he turned around
and he deleted his inbox
and called his brother and said,
"Hey, can you come help
me with my company?"
That was his second hire,
which was about four years into it.
And then he decided
that Wisconsin was cold
and so he at that point said,
"I want to move to somewhere warmer."
Sight unseen, he decided
on Portland, Oregon.
And so part of this interesting
part of this story is,
what he actually did was
put a message that said,
"My site is down."
And this is 2005.
So this is very unusual for a web-company,
that's already pulling in,
frankly, millions of dollars.
And put the servers on a truck
and flew himself.
And then physically chase down the truck
because it was going to the wrong address
on the other side in Portland.
Got the servers back, put them back up,
without realizing that
like his whole business
was essentially going to be on the line.
And there in Portland,
hired two more developers
and about ten more
customer support people.
And so, fast-forward to an end of 2008
and he looked at this business,
which, you know, in
Reid's terminology here,
was acting in the sense of,
size-wise was a "tribe",
but revenue size was already a "village".
And he knew he had reached a point
where he had no idea
how to take the company to the next level.
And for a founder to have
that much like prescient
of himself is just phenomenal, in my mind.
And so, he basically
hired essentially a banker
to help him say, "Look, I want essentially
"to get some liquidity for
myself and, most importantly,
"I want to bring in a professional CEO."
And that is just such
and unusual thing to do.
And so in April 2009 two
private equity firms,
so it was two-bay for a venture capital,
it was already like the
mountain of money needed
to buy Ryan and his brother out,
or to buy a portion of them out.
It was already too big.
And so, you know, Ryan is truly amazing,
and is one of the most, is
an extremely humble guy.
And one of the things
that he was looking for
was a professional CEO that held
that same culture and ethos.
And so, he, Spectrum Equity,
and been capital invested
and brought on a gentleman
named Dave Goldberg,
who, I think as many of you probably know,
passed unfortunately in May of this year,
but just had that same culture and ethos
of just being somebody who, you know,
was extremely intelligent
and extremely humble.
And that is something that
both Ryan and Dave shared.
But he realized it was time
to bring on a professional CEO
and did that, which is pretty interesting
for Silicon Valley.
- And this is essentially
where I started this,
because obviously Goldy and
I were talking about this
and Goldy was saying
what he was going to do
and I was like, "Oh, really? Portland?
"How is this going to work?"
And all these sorst of things.
And so, now let's get
to how you got to this.
So, Goldy calls you or you connect...
And what does the company look like then?
- Right, so, I was
actually working in London,
running European Product and
Technology for Ticketmaster.
So, we were in about 11 different markets,
I was having, frankly,
the time of my life.
I'd done Stanford and
Berlin when I was here,
and always wanted to go back to Europe.
So I had this opportunity
to move to London
and work in all these different markets.
But, I don't see that
many women in the room,
for the woman in the room,
I decided I wanted to start a family
and I was traveling about
60 to 70% of the time.
And so, I knew I wanted to take a job
where I wasn't traveling as much.
And I was ready for the innovation
of Silicon Valley again.
And I ran into Zander,
our Chairman of our Board,
and he introduced me to Dave.
When Dave first called
me, and this is true
of every single person at SurveyMonkey,
when Dave first called us,
we thought: surveys?
Like, are you kidding me, surveys?
But when you start to
understand the impact
of collecting feedback,
whether that's this classroom
feedback, hopefully,
or whether it's employee
feedback, patient satisfaction.
You start understanding the
power of listening to voices
and what you can do with that data.
And the thing that was amazing about Dave
was he had that vision in 2009.
He had that vision and that's
the same thing that Ryan saw,
was how do you take a vision of a company
that has been going for 10 years,
but realize you have a business
of essentially data collection?
I mean, you're all
computer scientists, right?
You know you can build
a form pretty quickly,
but how do you take a business, though,
that has tremendous scale,
think about how to both make it global,
but how to build additional value.
So, how do you build
insights and not just data?
And how do you think about providing
value back to the
customer on that feedback?
And Dave had that vision right from 2009
and I just couldn't have
been more excited about it.
- [Reid] How big was the
company when you joined?
- So it was 19.
I've finally joined in October of 2009,
there were 19 people.
There were three engineers and that's it.
The company already had millions of users,
tens of millions, and I'll
disclose the exact amount,
but tens on millions of revenue.
- [Reid] Your revenue
per employee wasn't bad.
- Yeah, and the margin was unbelievable,
if you think about that.
And there were three engineers.
there was one, David hired
one tech-house person
when he realized there was literally
no backup of the database. (Selina laughs)
And so, it was very small.
And Dave started bringing in,
essentially, various executives.
Tim Maly, this is our CFO,
he brought him in coming from Google.
He brought in someone to
help on international,
he brought me in.
So he brought various
sort of executives in,
knowing that the business
was this unique combination
of a small company in people size
and a scaled company, a
somewhat scaled company already.
I mean not LinkedIn
scale, but somewhat scaled
in terms of revenues and traffic.
- So what was the initial plan?
You get to a "tribe"
with "village" revenue,
you have to build to a village,
what was your initial, like,
oh my gosh, there's so
many things to do here.
How did you treat all that?
- So, the first big
thing was the platform.
So I'm CS Stanford, so kind of came in
on the technology side,
and it was this monolithic .NET platform
with literally, you know,
HTML from the database
to the app layer, to the front end.
Like it was sort of sprinkled everywhere.
And these guys have done,
though, a fantastic job.
If you think about the
fact that two people,
two to three people,
had really built this
application that's scaled.
But it's scaled from
a traffic perspective,
but not an adding developer perspective.
So the big thing that I had to figure out
is how were we going to
start taking advantage
of all this business opportunity,
but at the same time,
we had a platform that we couldn't use
from a scale perspective.
So, that was the first big decision.
And the decision I made was to split,
rather than say we're going to, like,
take a bunch of developers,
put them in Fiji and go replicate the site
in a different language.
We decided to take, you know,
front area of the site
by area of the site.
And think about what are the most
important things to do first.
And the first thing we decided was that,
given the fact that the business is viral
and it's not necessarily
like directly viral
like Facebook or LinkedIn,
but it's viral in the sense of the fact
that there had been no marketing.
Not a penny of search engine
marketing had been spent.
When we asked Ryan what
marketing he did, he said,
"Well, I put a gorilla suit on and I stood
"at the back of the Today show."
He wasn't on the Today show,
he was like in the crowd waving.
That was like what he told us
was the marketing he'd done.
So there had been no--
- [Reid] I think it was
literally gorilla marketing--
- Literally! Literally, right?
So he had done like basically...
So there's, you know,
you want to drive search,
but you knew there was this
viral component of the business.
And so the earlier we can start
that virality in more markets,
the better long-term we would be.
So the first thing we
decide we'd want to do
is quickly globalize the platform.
So we were able to use
a third-party proxy,
that did some of the translation
to try to quickly within
six months get out the door
about five to ten languages.
And the main thing we actually
needed to write-rewrite
was the billing system.
And the billings first.
The billing system basically had...
If you changed the price, it would change
for even existing customers.
I mean it was pretty hard-coded.
And so we rebuilt the billing system
with 28 different currencies,
a bunch of ability to
add different packages,
different payment methods internationally.
Which is all very important
to just enable people to buy your product.
So that was kind of our first thing.
And then we've gone area by area:
survey creation and survey analytics--
- Before you go through all of that,
so, you had three engineers.
- [Selina] Yes.
- You had a hard-coded system.
- [Selina] Yes.
- And add proven product,
market-fit revenue.
- Yes.
- What are the first
three hires they make?
- So, that's a great question.
The very first hire I actually made
was a user experience designer.
Because our product when we did...
so I sat there and ran
through usertesting.com
and watch five videos.
And the first thing I realized
is there were so much,
you know, quote-unquote,
"low-hanging fruit", of
how people were getting
to the experience and
learning about the experience.
And I thought if I could fix
some of these things quickly
on the current platform
and already kind of
take a tick up in the business growth,
that would give me some air cover
to start rebuilding the
technology platform.
So that was the very first hire I made.
It was a gentleman from
LinkedIn. (Selina laughs)
- [Reid] I remember
that amazing site, yes.
That wasn't a code this talk about Brian,
but yes.
- Fantastic user experience designer.
And then the second was
a head of engineering.
A head of engineering who
was also from LinkedIn.
- As I remember that too.
This really wasn't code
for that, but keep going.
This is part of how
Silicon Valley operates,
because people actually...
The book that Chris and I
authored on the alliances
is actually people do tours of duty,
they work one place, then other place,
that is action back the way it operates.
- And you take companies that are awesome
and amazing and doing well,
and you try to say...
I mean those are the companies
that as smaller companies you look up to.
And you're thinking about,
how do we take some of that talent?
Then I hired the director of engineering
and her first job was to figure out
what language we should use.
Because we knew we needed
to rebuild the platform,
we were building the team in
Silicon Valley and we knew
that there was not a
good community for .NET.
So we looked at Python, Ruby, and Java,
and we made the decision on Python.
- [Reid] What made you make
the decision on Python?
- So I looked at three factors.
I had like this deep spreadsheet.
The first was hiring, was who can we hire
and what are the communities available?
The second was, what is the scale?
So we looked at other
companies that were using
different languages at the time and, like,
how people had scaled
with those languages.
And then the third was around
just the comparables.
Because again and that really
goes back to hiring and scale,
but it is really kind of focused
on those different things
because those are going to end up
being the factors that matter.
Both scale of the tech platform but also,
how can you have a
scaled development team?
- And did you have a target for how many
engineers you'd have within 12 month?
- That I don't remember
because I was also four
and a half months pregnant
when I started.
And so I was also going on
maternity leave in March.
But yeah, I don't
remember the exact target,
but we were just hiring
as quickly as we could,
I think we ended up with
about 8 or 10 at the end
of that first year from an
engineering perspective,
a couple product and a couple UX.
- And then how much...
I mean global obviously
played a significant role
for billing and currencies.
How much was the thought of, okay, now,
part of beginning to prep
for really massive scale,
was kind of the global scope key?
- Yeah, so in terms of, you know, again
we were really focused globally from...
Get the platform ready
and not necessarily,
you know, we weren't
putting people locally,
we weren't putting any
footprint locally yet.
It was, get the platform
and start that viral engine.
And so that was really our
focus from a global perspective,
it was, launch the different languages
and you do see an up-tick
when you launch different languages.
And then the second piece of it
is giving them that ability to pay.
So that was really our only
initial global strategy.
- Got it, and how about
any pattern differences on virality?
- Globally? Absolutely.
There's a huge difference both
in terms of virality globally...
And that is based on the number of years
into how much that brand
has been in market.
Because when you're
depending upon a viral funnel
you're very much depending
upon the fact that
that customer has awareness of the brand.
And so you start seeing
impact when people oversee
their second, third,
fourth, fifth surveys.
And then you start getting
more of the viral funnel going.
And that was actually
true at Evite as well.
At Evite you had an average
of 18 invitees to one user,
but you needed to receive
a certain number of evites
before you then created.
And so when you're thinking
about those viral models,
you have to think about there's like
the primary step viral models
and then these secondary
step viral models.
- And how many like different cohorts
were you tracking?
What's the rough size of the A/B testing?
- Yeah, so that's a great point.
That was the other
thing we did right away.
We launched A/B testing.
It was fascinating to
realize that, you know,
Ryan had such gorgeous product instinct,
but he had grown on by instinct.
He hadn't done a single A/B test.
And so we added in just
right away an A/B testing,
very simple, like A/B testing
home page, the end page,
which was the page when you
finished taking the survey.
Start testing, you know, do
you want to check out flow
that's three pages versus five pages?
How do you want to show your pricing page?
And just your experience.
And we just started heavily,
heavily A/B testing.
If you haven't A/B tested
before and you're at that scale,
and there will be a scale
you hit where you can start,
because it's easy to get
statistical significance,
if a test takes more than
like two or three months
it's just hard to really
get any motion behind it.
But once you get to that point
then there's so many easy
witness you can have.
Because you suddenly have that traffic
to start seeing user behavior.
- We did something,
our first hack on this
within LinkedIn was,
we actually set up a simple
A/B testing infrastructure
that essentially was on a Mode 10,
so you could do up to 10
different cell variants,
you do two--
- At eBay we did like
user, auto even user ids.
- Yep, that would be...
Although you have to get a certain amount
of volume--
- [Selina] to get, yeah.
- Oh, eBay was actually one of the very...
That, PayPal and the
SixDegrees, and a few others
were the very first virality,
they're actually ones
really deploying virality.
So then, one of the other pieces of visas
in terms of getting ready for boot scaling
was when you began to do
this kind of metrization,
what did that mean for dashboards?
What did that mean for analytics?
What did that mean for data?
- So, there were no analytics before 2009.
Like there was the Daily Cash Report
and that was it.
And so, as far as understanding
and first establishing
what were the key metrics
that we actually wanted to establish.
And I strongly believe,
you as a whole company
can't get initially behind
more than three to five,
and then there was the
drivers underneath it.
So the fist thing we needed to do
was actually put the data
into a data warehouse
and then actually start
looking at the data.
But then we started to having to build
all the dashboards globally.
You have an activity dashboard,
which is what people are doing,
your metrics dashboard in terms
of your subscriber counts.
But we have different dashboards.
And everything sort of gets multiplied
by the number of countries.
So there's more to watch.
But for a subscription-based business,
which is probable the same as LinkedIn,
the key metrics are the
number of free users,
your free users that become paying users.
But for us the other main
key metric is engagement.
So, how many users actually
deploy their survey,
how many responses they
get and then, of course,
how many users stay with you,
so what's your turn rate.
- So let's turn a little
bit back to hiring.
So the first couple of hires were,
let's go raid a, another
company. (Selina laughs)
And then after that, what was the plan?
- So, for an engineering side,
because we had chosen Python--
- [Reid] Oh, I didn't not
promise to make you blush
while we were doing this. (Selina laughs)
- Because we were doing Python
we did a lot of, you
know, we went to meetups,
we went to...
Oh, we hired our first Stanford intern,
who now runs all of our mobile.
And so we came to Stanford
and did a bunch of recruiting here.
Yeah, we did Python meetups and
tried to get a lot of people
on the Python community
from the engineering side.
But you hire also just
a traditional recruiter,
who is out there on LinkedIn,
and trying to get talent.
But that was also one of the first hires
we made was a recruiter,
and the data analyst, like you said.
- And on the recruiter, was
there anything in particular
that you were thinking as a
right thing to do in order
to hire effectively?
- So, it was funny because,
the recruiter still tells this story,
but basically sat me down,
I had just come from Europe,
and he had come from Google.
And so he had all of this was still
when Google was hiring based on GPA
and all of this stuff.
And he sat me down and he said,
"Okay, so I've all these
criteria," he said,
"What's your criteria?"
And I said, "I want no assholes
who can solve problems."
And that's it.
And he's like, "Well, how am
I going to screen for that?"
I'm like, "I can screen
for that." (Selina laughs)
You find me good talented people,
like, you find me good people
who have like raw talent and
we can figure the rest out.
They don't need to
necessarily have known Python,
they don't necessarily need to have...
They need to have raw good
problem solving and coding skills.
And that has been kind of
our philosophy throughout.
And we've had pretty good
luck hiring that way.
And I feel like that's helped
build a very good culture.
And that was Dave's philosophy as well.
He wrote a nice LinkedIn post about it.
- [Reid] I remember.
And how, as you scaled, how did you keep
that culture and hiring philosophy?
- So it's been important
to us from the start.
But we basically, it
goes into our screens,
such as we don't ask people...
people do code on a whiteboard.
You know, like the engineers
so code on the whiteboard,
but they can choose the
language of their choice,
as an example.
And then, we ask everybody,
we've been trying to do the
sort of unconscious bias,
like making sure we were interviewing
without trying to just
take people like yourselves
by asking the kind of the
same set of questions,
then it's better to do
behavioral questioning.
So it's much better to do, ask somebody,
how would you solve this problem?
Or what would you do in this situation?
Than necessarily asking someone
how they did something in the past.
So I think that's been
a really important thing
for us in the interviewing.
- [Reid] And how many
engineers are you now roughly?
- We're about 150, but there have been
two to three acquisitions
that have significantly added
to that engineering count.
- [Reid] And when did you
start doing the acquisitions?
- Dave liked doing deals.
We did a major deal actually in 2012,
which was buying our largest competitor
called Zoomerang.
And that was a huge thing
because we had to within
nine month deprecate
their entire technology platform
and move all the customers
over to our system.
And so, it was a major effort
from the technology teams.
But we do have a few of
our strongest developers
from that acquisition.
- If you were to go
back and call yourself,
be able to tell yourself before you went
into that acquisition or the tech move,
what would you tell
yourself to do differently?
- Once again, not go on
maternity leave the second time
in the middle of it, but besides that...
Besides that, I would say,
the biggest thing was,
we were really set on
replicating all of the features
that were on their platform,
because we wanted to make
sure all of the customers
had a fantastic experience
when they'd move over.
Because we were causing
them to like switch brands
when they had made
clearly an active choice
between two competitors, right?
But in retrospect, you
have to balance that versus
the opportunity cost of everything
we could have been doing.
So I maybe would have spent, you know,
there were a few features
that I think that we probably
didn't have to build on SurveyMonkey,
that weren't applicable
enough or large enough
for the audience.
But I think, in general, it was...
I was very proud of the team
and we did it within nine months.
- By the way, you may not know this,
but PayPal merged with
its primary competitor,
a company called X.com,
very early in the time.
X.com was running NT,
whereas PayPal was actually mostly C++,
not even Java and Solaris,
some Java on that.
And one of the things when I think about
what I essentially call my younger self
it's be more decisive about, like
okay, this is what the new tech universe
is going to look like right away.
Like, Oh, we're going
to kind of talk about it
and we're going to figure
out what's best and so forth.
There was just tremendous
brain damage from that.
It was like, nope, we do it this way--
- That we did like within the first week
I was like removing all the customers
when we're bringing everybody over.
So that part was good.
It was more than, okay,
what do you do then,
which feature set?
- [Voiceover] I've a
question on recruiting.
Why is behavioral worse
than asking about the past?
- Why is behavioral better?
- [Voiceover] Better, yeah, exactly.
- It creates less bias,
especially around things like
women and people of color,
who tend to have...
There's a lot of research on,
actually a lot of research from Stanford.
But, is because women tend
to sell themselves short
in what they were saying that they did
and men tend to say they
did more than they did,
as an example.
And so, if you give somebody
a situation of the future,
which is how would you
handle this situation,
you tend to get actually better.
- [Voiceover] And then why my question is:
what was the most productive
recruit in general,
which one was the one where
you wasted the most time?
- Most productive would
always, always, always
be employer referrals.
If you get great people
and they're always going
to refer great people,
If they like the place that you work,
I assume you found that.
Obviously, when you're
starting from scratch,
and don't have employees,
I mean, LinkedIn is the
best place to recruit.
I'm not just saying this because
I'm sitting next to Reid.
- [Reid] Or feeling guilty.
- Or feeling guilty.
But no, I meant your
application, not your company.
(laughing)
But the second,
I would say as far as probably
the worst channel...
That's a great question, actually--
- [Reid] Or a couple of bad channels.
- We didn't tend to find like a lot
of the career fairs
because a lot of the time is the people
attending career fairs aren't
the same people that like...
We didn't find career fairs
generally very useful,
except Grace Hopper one was good,
the women's conference,
but in general, we didn't find
career fairs very helpful.
I mean in college career
fairs are good, like Stanford,
but in terms of like, you know,
other ones that are put on
more generally, not that good.
- So let's talk about a
little bit about how you also
evolved the product as you were growing.
Because you had this, you know, you start
with a small number of engineers,
super hard-coded,
tech-platformed basically,
none of the serious companies
in Silicon Valley use.
With already a partially global scope,
but in need to go more global.
So you have to kind of do all that,
you have to fix all that,
you have to make it more modular,
you have to bring in data,
you have to essentially do, you know,
the data all sorts of ties to virality
and all the rest of the stuff.
But you also have to evolve the product.
You have to say: okay,
in order to affect our scale curve,
these are the kinds of things that we need
to do with the product.
I wonder what was the "low-hanging fruit",
that already came with the,
"I'm going to hire a user
experience designer."
There's so much basic
stuff that would then
improve, increase conversion usage.
What are the others?
- So the best investment that we had
or the biggest, you know,
a strong believe we had
was that over time the sort
of creation on the surveys
may get commoditized, which is, you know,
the creating forums, creating surveys.
There's still a lot there,
like there is advanced logic,
there is all these things
that people want to do.
But that actually trying to
create insights out of the data
was where we wanted to innovate,
we wanted to help
customers understand data.
So we invested a lot and
we continue to invest a lot
in terms of our analytics.
Which was, how do you let customers easily
slice and dice the
data, understand trends.
And one of the big things we
launched was comparative data,
which takes a lot of work
because you need people
to use a similar question set,
like use questions from a question bank,
but then look at comparative data.
We might get feedback
about how this class was,
and you guys might have said it was okay,
but we don't know if it
was more okay or less okay
than the different class.
And so, how do we compare
across the spectrum
of your other Stanford classes?
And that's what you need
to know and understand
if your class was good or bad
and then we start to building
out a benchmark's product.
So these are the things
where we're really focused
on providing the analytics
to the customers.
- And what were, when
you began thinking about,
okay, we're going to be global.
How did you begin to figure out
what is the right partization
of which key features
would unlock the scale?
- So, in terms of, like I said,
the very first and basic thing
was letting them pay you.
So the payments, which is,
you know, obviously like
integrating PayPal,
integrating bank transfer.
In Germany 60% of the users
pay with bank transfer
because since World War II
people didn't get credit cards as much.
So the payment market in all these markets
is very different.
So that's something just by nature
that you have to just allow.
So that sort of like base-building blocks.
And then for us,
obviously, the translation
is like base-building blocks.
What we found is that
very much in product,
like once you're in the product,
you didn't need that much customization.
Besides the basic things:
state format, all that stuff.
But it was really about
how you were talking
about your product that
needed to be localized.
So, what types of use
cases are people doing
in different markets differently?
The concept of collecting
employee feedback
is very foreign in some markets,
like it's not something
that's done in every market.
And so it's more about how you're talking
about your customers
and also how you're
representing in those pages.
In Japan, as an example,
the number of images on the home page,
I think is about three to four x that
on average in the US home page.
And so those were the
things that we had to start,
we've done some and we
still have more to do.
- Do you actually make that?
For example, that Japan translation?
- So, in Japan we're
actually doing only now.
- Got it, that struck me as
a very specific number here.
So, when you begin to think
about going to market,
for example, one of the
things you discovered is
different markets would
actually use surveys
for different things.
- [Selina] Yes.
- Whether it's employees' satisfaction--
- [Selina] Or it was in education, yeah.
- What was some of the lessons there
that unlocking those lessons
actually really helped to scale?
- So, I think it's again,
it's, you kind of said it,
it's really watching the metrics
and understanding what people are doing
and so therefore you're
talking to them more
about what they're doing,
because your brand awareness
in these markets is tiny.
And so, the difference in
the US is we can say, like,
"Hey, create a survey and get answers."
In other markets we need to say, like,
"Oh, here's all of the things
you can do with a survey,
"here's why you may want
to create a survey."
Suddenly you turn to a lot
more educational content
that has to be relevant for their market.
It's more about that
lack of brand awareness.
- [Reid] Any particular
countries that were surprises
on the upside or downside?
- I wouldn't say so, like in terms of,
the English markets are easier.
I mean the other thing, obviously,
which also as we started doing a lot
of search engine optimization
and search engine marketing per market,
and so you're starting to build
up content pages per market.
But it's obviously easier to
do that in English markets.
And so, even, you know,
our business was almost all US
when we started in 2009,
now it's about 60% US
and 40% international,
but a chunk of that is
just international English.
But no, it's very much
based on market size
and internet penetration.
So, where you start looking
at the next base markets
of Germany and so forth.
- Anything that was
particularly interesting on...
One thing that most
people know intuitively
is how virality works.
The product is used in an invitation send,
someone touches it, they may convert,
there's a whole bunch
of different analysis
about getting the
K-factors, and time series,
and cohort analysis, and
all of that's to do that.
SEO and SEM, that was important.
What was some of the key lessons there?
By the way, LinkedIn, very similarly,
one of the things we realized was
that one of the things that members wanted
was a public profile page and so we said,
okay, let's allow you to
upload a profile page,
let's allow that being dexed in Google
and then that became another half
by which LinkedIn was discovered.
Were there similar things?
- Yes, the most similar thing
is one of the big ways
you build link authority
is by having links all over the web.
Well, SurveyMonkey has
links all over the web.
So our link authority was great in the US.
So we needed to create localized domains
and, you know, country-level domains
and start sending the
surveys out on those domains.
So that you start building
up link authority locally.
And so that you start ranking
in those local search engines.
That's really important for local SEO.
And similarly, start putting on
your logged-out site experience
kind of on that to build up the local SEO.
But starting create those backlinks
were very important for us.
- Did you encourage customers...
That's a stretch, not a question, right?
- [Voiceover] That's certainly a question.
- Okay.
- [Voiceover] How do you start
when you're going to any market,
do you do like a market campaign?
What do you do to get going?
- So for us because we already had
users in those countries,
we just started switching
the survey traffic
over to those domains.
But in markets where we
had very little traffic
we were also buying the key
words to start off with.
So we were starting to buy
some of the search traffic.
But you have to start
figuring out by market
which were the key words that have traffic
and start building out content pages
on those key words.
And so we also did that
from a search engine
optimization perspective.
- [Voiceover] In terms
of building processes
from the part of it was
that percolate across
different geographies,
how do you manage that?
- So we didn't have, we still don't have
product and engineering globally.
All of our product and engineering...
And we have a large
development center in Ottawa,
which was also through an acquisition,
but we've grown that quite significantly.
But all of the product
and engineering right now
we're doing, is done kind
of in a centralized way
across the platform.
So, our development
methodologies don't necessarily
have to change for global.
Everybody does need to be able to have
sort of a Pig Latin
version of the application
on their site and their code base.
So that you can start understanding
because on average it's like,
I think, 1.3 length of
language versus English.
You have to start just
making sure you're developing
and designing for
international from the start.
But we do it centrally.
I think you guys, LinkedIn has people--
- Yeah, we're pretty central,
central on R&amp;D.
We have offices in 30+ countries
relative to sales, account management,
customer service, these sorts of things.
Okay, so, customers.
Did you actually try to get your customers
to publish the results of
their surveys as part of SEO?
- So, we have the ability
for customers to say,
"I allow you to publish this publicly."
The promise is that...
A lot of our usage is for people to try
to find out feedback around either
like employees, or patients, or so forth.
There's not necessarily something
that people want to share.
But what we did do is
we launched a business,
again, using our scale,
we took the end of the survey page
of people who had seen it a few times,
and we built out from that page a panel.
So basically, we asked people
if they wanted to take a survey,
and if they took a survey,
in turn we would give 50 cents to charity.
So we used this scale of this page,
which was basically a
large marketing page,
and built out a secondary
business on top of it.
And in that business
we run studies and ask people questions
and publish that data out,
so it's like higher quality data
and that does help with SEO and key terms.
- Yeah, that makes sense actually.
It would be the classic thing
where you can get actually
some super high quality results
would be very interesting
from an SEO perspective,
but difficult to get.
So one of the things I think is endemic
to kind of part of the
thread that is Web 2.0
is data as a platform.
Where you start thinking about
what kinds of new
applications you can build,
given that you have
essentially a pile of data.
How do you guys think about that?
- Yes, we absolutely think about it,
it's one of the most important
things that we think about.
As I was talking about,
when you start building
these comparative data sets...
I mean this market to build benchmarks
is, on average, tens
of thousands of dollars
to even hundreds of thousands dollars
to get a benchmark.
We offer right now for
600 bucks or 800 bucks
because we have this platform
and we have this scale of all these users,
and we're able to aggregate the data
and anonymize it, of course,
and then create an awesome benchmark.
- [Voiceover] And what kinds
of things are being benchmark?
- And also a student may not understand
why benchmarks are so important,
so say that too.
- So, right now employee
satisfaction we have,
we have net promoter score,
which is how you might
do customer satisfaction,
we have a K-12 Parent-Education survey,
and we have an event feedback template
you can get benchmark.
So it's basically, where you
start building enough data
that's statistically significant
or you can slice it and dice it by one.
So if you think about classroom feedback,
Stanford probably would want to look
at other universities similar to them
in order to see if Stanford
was in comparing it.
Or within campus you probably
would maybe want to...
Like a CS professor may want to compare it
against other CS classes.
We don't have enough data significance
for a classroom feedback, though.
- So, let's shift to management.
And this is not so much of a code
about difficulties with Goldy.
But as much as, you're going
to build a company for scale,
Goldy hires you, Goldy hires Tim.
How do you build up the
rest of the management?
What are the principles of that?
So we talked about hiring already some,
but how does...
like putting in a management
layer into the company?
- This has been one of the most fun,
but also hardest challenges we've had.
So, we had a very specific thing that
both Dave and I believed in
from a management perspective,
a couple of things.
One is that we really liked to find people
who had had some startup experience,
but also some scale experience.
If you look at Dave, he had started
at a company called LAUNCH,
but had also been running
all of the Yahoo Music.
I started Evite, but I had
also been running, you know,
250 people at Ticketmaster.
So it was like finding that people
who had done both, a
mix of small and scale.
And so, our head of
product, similarly he had
kind of been at Yahoo, which
was more scaled company
and then been in startup called TripIt.
So we were in general
trying to find people
who had a little bit of that balance.
Because we liked the culture
of the small company,
and we have the culture, had the culture,
still somewhat have the
culture of a small company.
- [Reid] How big are you
now, how many people?
- About 690.
It's heading towards the city, I know,
I was like, I need to sit on
the other side of this class.
But finding people who can scale up
as you go is hard and some people won't.
We had a fantastic guy
who was responsible for
various things and...
They came to a point where he started
having to manage managers
and he didn't enjoy it.
Like it wasn't fun for
him, he didn't like it.
And he was great at the hands on
like getting stuff done,
managing a couple of people,
leading a small team.
So when we were in that
sort of tribe stage,
he was fantastic, but
then he didn't necessarily
get to a point where he
scaled to that next level.
And then there's some people that have.
And our general view is we
really like hiring from within,
with all of our engineering managers
almost all except one have
been hired from within.
It's been something that's been
important to us culturally,
but there does come the
place where you actually
need to bring an expert
who's done it before.
And so, it's finding that
right balance of kind of
keeping people and helping
them grow and keeping that.
They understand the
culture of the company,
they have the right
motivations along with people
that are bringing that
experience to the table.
- This one we covered a little bit.
We introduced the whole kind of
what are the challenges of beginning
to scale and multi-thread your company,
basically Tuesday.
And one of the things
this whole question about,
how much do you hire externally
and how much do you promote within,
and how do you identify those people
and how are you navigating
and how do you keep the people
that you actually really want to keep,
even though you're not
promoting them into the role.
What was some of the considerations there?
- Yeah, I take that last
thing is one of the hardest,
if not impossible,
which is when you have to layer people
and then keeping them
motivated and excited,
because it's very hard for somebody
who's been responsible for a function
or responsible for things.
And even though it makes sense
that as the company grows
your role may get smaller.
It doesn't mean that your role
has actually gotten smaller,
your role has actually gotten bigger,
but the scope of it has gotten smaller,
but in a bigger company.
That's very hard for people
in general to stuck--
- Although, what you also just revealed
is that is actually, by the way,
the classic language that mostly people
who were trying to do this did this.
Actually in fact your job is bigger.
One person running this,
this privileged group now
and you're not that person,
but your job is actually still
bigger than it was before.
- Right, exactly.
That is difficult.
There will be some people
who really only enjoy
that tribe stage of companies,
or really enjoy sort of the tribe
to the beginning of the village.
And there are serial people
who like going through that.
And that's great.
If you know that that's what you love,
that's great!
Like, you know, there's a woman
who did international LinkedIn
and did it at SurveyMonkey,
and you're going to hear her from your app
and she's done,
internationally at Nextdoor.
- [Reid] Actually that's funny.
Minna was at LinkedIn,
then SurveyMonkey, and the Nextdoor--
- But she is absolutely
fantastic at driving,
setting the platform for
international when you start.
But there's a point where she's like,
"hey, I've done it, and
then I go to the next one."
And so there will be people like that
who really enjoy certain
scale or size of the company,
and that's fantastic.
It's like figuring out what you enjoy.
The hardest piece is when people
were running a function
and then you need to bring people,
that is tough.
- The other part that highlights
with Minna and specific is,
part of the arc that we have
ventured as you start with,
you're always hiring generalists,
but how you deploying them generally.
Generalist early is doing everything,
then you're covering the new ground,
the in-between the different
areas of specialization.
The new entrepreneurial
project you're doing panels,
you're doing benchmarking,
you're doing these kinds of things.
But you're also hiring
much more specialists.
And part of what Minna is,
is an internationalization specialist,
who's like, I know this game, hold,
and this is how you play
it and this is what you do.
And this is how you come from a company
that hasn't thought about it
and move into a company that does,
which is precisely what she has been--
- And there will be some people, though,
that scale extremely well.
The woman who I mentioned,
who started as the BI Analyst,
like when I said one
of my first five hires,
she now is our VP of Growth and Analytics.
So there are those people
who can scale and grow,
and there's those people who can't.
And that is the hard thing,
because you obviously know
people who you've worked with
for a couple of years, two-three years,
you want everybody to scale and grow.
- [Reid] And as you were
scaling, did your sense
of what competition look like
or what the opportunity look like change?
- Absolutely.
One of the things is
that there's many factors
that go on around you in terms of
what the large players are doing.
So, even in our case, we have...
Google has a Forms product and so...
It has some similarities.
And so, you see larger
players making changes
and then you also see upstarts
that start really specializing.
So there is somebody that, you know,
has built a really nice product
specifically around
just employee engagement
and they're going after
just that HR space.
So, you constantly see competition
when you're a large general platform.
It's just a question of
how significant is it,
and how much is it
affecting your business,
and where do you want to think about M&amp;A,
like we did with Zoomerang
and FluidSurveys.
- Did you do any M&amp;A
that wasn't actually within your space?
- We did like an adjacent, like Wufoo,
which was a forms-based product,
but not really.
- And you haven't set up
an Acquihires Department yet for--
- So we did use some
member of Y Combinator,
didn't quite make it.
- Because actually that's another pattern.
So there's major acquisitions
which are strategic,
and then there's a number
of small acquisitions
which is part of you get
entrepreneurial people.
- Absolutely, and those are great.
The acquihires are great
in terms of like findings.
Because those turn out to be...
we did this one acquirehire
and the two guys were still
there five years later
and they're basically running
that entire audience business
from private and engineering perspective.
Just amazing talent.
- And how did you feel about,
you mentioned Google Forms,
how do the large players figure in,
whether it's Google or Microsoft or..?
Obviously, some of what you must do
is social graph optimization as well,
given Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn.
- Yeah, I think that in
general it's a question
of where is the right
place to partner as well.
And so, thinking about how do you create
the right partnerships and work within
their ecosystem as well.
- [Student] What was
some of the acquihires,
how did you identify them?
Because in small companies
like no one's really heard of.
- Yeah, the really small ones.
In general, it is a pretty small valley
and so when you have like good talent,
whether or not making it,
whether it's one of the
Y Combinator companies,
or just other ones, like you'll get a call
into your M&amp;A--
- [Student] Same as some
of them came to you?
- Most of them came through Dave.
Dave had a very wide vast network.
- The usual pattern for that is,
you probably have a corped person now,
but the usual pattern of
having corped out person
who this is their daily job
is that part of the reason
why you're intensely
focused on being connected
in the Silicon Valley network.
Some of that through investors,
some of that through, you know,
keep people in the company,
founders, executives, etc.
That almost all comes
from some version of that.
So it's like, Oh, you know,
Dave knows Sam Altman.
Sam calls Dave, says:
hey, there's this group
that actually really likes you
and maybe you should consider--
- Yeah, we're doing
something slightly similar,
the kind of passion about surveys,
like the one I mentioned,
they were doing like phone polling.
And we did another one which was
like somebody I had worked with in 1999,
like their company.
As you start building your network,
you'll hear about, people will reach out
if they enjoyed working with you.
Yeah, or you identifying it, I'm not sure.
- [Voiceover] Speaking of that point,
isn't it super expensive?
I mean I kind of have no idea--
(hum drowns out speaker)
- [Reid] You mean acquihire is expensive?
(hum drowns out speaker)
- That is actually the
usual benchmark for that,
which is a million per engineer.
Actually in fact, it's
expensive if you said:
this is the only way I'm hiring.
(hum drowns out speaker)
- Absolutely, but by the way,
it's not any five engineers,
it's the white five engineers.
And part of what you're
usually doing in that case,
that's five engineers who work
really, really well together,
who've demonstrated
entrepreneurial ability,
who can be part of the new blood
of really driving something pretty serious
in what you're doing.
That is actually in fact
worth of every single buck.
- And remember, it's going to
be a mix of cash and equity.
So it's also equity in
your current company
that they are hopefully
making a big impact on.
- [Voiceover] That's
assuming that's over some
time frame as well?
- [Selina] Yeah.
- Almost always, minimum two years,
sometimes four.
The whole question is,
I mean the alignment
of incentives question,
when you get to compensation,
is actually extremely important
in circumstances like these.
It's important all of the time,
but extremely important here.
Did you have a question? Okay.
(hum drowns out speaker)
- That's a great question.
- And by the way, why
don't you restate it,
just to make sure we're going on.
- So, the question was,
did SurveyMonkey have anything
to try to reduce bias in the questions.
One of the most interesting
things you'll see
is if you actually ask people
if they agree or disagree.
In the US they're going to mostly agree.
Just by nature Americans
like to agree with things.
- [Reid] I disagree. (Selina laughs)
- But this research is also from Stanford.
And actually the amount
of that changes by market,
which is what really interesting.
- Have you ever published
what that percentage is?
- We have it on by-post,
but I don't remember right.
- I guess I'll go find that bummer.
- So what we did is we actually
built a couple things.
One is we have this question bank
which helps you create,
write the questions,
or use the questions that are worded
in the right way with
the right answer options.
Because the difference in
terms of how the answer options
are also worded, need
to be equally spaced.
And so we worked to make sure
that the questions themselves
kind of help reduce bias.
The other thing is we have
the amount of functionality
so you can randomize.
You can randomize options,
you can randomize things.
So that you're actually not.
Because people often choose
the first thing as well.
But there's definitely
things that you can do
on a technological level.
Also post the surveys or help people with
responding quality and survey quality,
like make sure that things are good.
And we are making some
investments there now.
(hum drowns out speaker)
- So let me slightly
generalize that question,
because it was covering different parts.
What are the competitive barriers
to SurveyMonkey as it succeeds its scale,
isn't that reflects one of them
and if so, how so and
what are the other ones?
- Great, so in terms of
just in general, though,
one of the main competitive barriers
is going to be both your data.
So if you've been using the product,
you start wanting to
see your data over time.
And then the second is, as we build,
as we provide you the
comparative data sets
that also is a competitive differentiator
that most people don't have.
But part of the reason why
we've done acquisitions
is because similar compannies...
Is because once you
choose a survey product
and your data starts going in there
and you have that data over time,
your willingness to move
products is very low.
So when people are churned
out of SurveyMonkey,
the main thing they tell
us why they've churned
is because they don't have
a need fro it right now
but I'm going to be back.
And so, that is a huge
competitive differentiator
that you actually have.
But it is also, again, like I said,
it's the more you can do to provide
people insights of the
data the better you are,
whether it's the open-ended feedback.
so trying to do natural
language processing.
We have a basic text analysis today,
but that's another place
that we're investing.
- Feel free to ponder on this question,
it was too sensitive,
but what have you found in particular
about the re-engagement?
So, how do you model the re-engagement,
to get the customer
who is apparently churned back in?
- So we spend a lot of
time of re-engagement
both through emailing the customer
and also through re-targeting
on both LinkedIn and Facebook.
So, trying to find the
customer where they are
and remind them that they should
re-engage to do feedback.
So we have very specific
re-engagement curves,
which we don't share.
- That's what I figured,
because I realized that this would be
a very sensitive area,
which is the reason I framed it as,
only what you can say.
- But it is a very significant
portion of our business,
is getting people to essentially
come back and re-use you.
So existing customers
kind of paying you again.
- [Reid] Do you use any
machine learning on that?
- We do use propensity model,
which is using, based on users' behavior,
which is looking at what
types of surveys they've done
and using a bunch of variables
to decide when to re-contact them.
And similarly with what
we should show them
at the end of he survey.
- [Reid] Yep-yep, makes sense.
Oh, question.
(hum drowns out speaker)
- Yeah, so for me there's three things--
- By the way, restate the question--
- Sorry, the question was...
You know, when I first heard Surveys
it didn't sound that interesting.
But it was a scaled company,
that was one of the things
that attracted me to it.
So, what are the important
things to think about?
For my mind, there's three
important things to think about
when you're thinking about
your company, a company.
Whether you're starting it from scratch
or you're going to a company.
And the first is the product.
So I said that when I first heard Surveys
I didn't think it was that interesting,
but what excited me was
how all of the people
were actually using the
data and listening to
whether it was their
customers, their students,
their parents, their patients.
Like the product is the
most important thing
in terms of you need to be excited about,
especially as an engineer
you're going to spend
all of your time
developing and building it.
And that is very important to me.
The second is always
going to be the people.
I mentioned Dave, I've
mentioned him many times,
he was a fantastic leader,
the best mentor and manager
I've ever had in my career.
But having people and then for me
it was also the opportunity
to build my team.
So I could choose the people I wanted
and help build that culture.
That's always the second thing.
And the third thing is what
you are going to learn there.
And for me the part that
I was going to learn
was could we actually take this company
that was at scale from a size-perspective,
so we get A/B test and learn,
but the team was small,
and scale it up.
And that was the part
that I hadn't done before,
that I was super excited about.
I'd had this small company Evite
that we grew it to 30
people when we sold it.
And I've been at Ticketmaster
which was humongous.
But actually taking that company
from that small size to large
was what I was super excited to learn.
It's been six years and a
fantastic learning experience.
- The other thing I would add,
which I'm sure is part
of the SurveryMonkey,
but if you begin to say,
so two critiques of Peter's statement,
one of them is essentially that
actually in fact software's transforming
a number of different industries.
And so actually in fact, the fact
you're getting a revolution in bits
actually means that you're also
getting a revolution in atoms.
The second part of it is that,
in the 50's they were
expecting flying cars,
but they weren't expecting mobile phones.
It's kind of is a way of doing this.
Now, the key thing is that intelligence
and how you operate
actually massively increases productivity,
whether it's an individual
or an organization.
And so part of your actual
mission is trying to...
Whatever the individual or mission,
how do you help them operate
much more intelligently?
- Yeah, how do you help people
make better decisions with data?
That is an exciting mission.
And like you have to be super excited
about the mission of your company
if you're going to stay there for a while.
- Have you ever heard Tufte come talk at,
Edward Tufte, visual design?
- No, but I've read the books.
- You should have him come talking...
Anyway--
- [Voiceover] I just have a quick question
about re-engagement again.
(hum drowns out speaker)
- No, that's all in-house
- [Voiceover] How much
of the re-engagement
is like a percentage of
all of your customers?
- That's the piece that we don't share.
- By the way, one generalization,
more or less one of the
truths of any business
so much of the scale the scaled thing is,
anything that
machine-critical is in-house.
Anything like this is the
key thing by which we win,
if that's out of house,
that's a major risk factor.
An intelligent manager
is trying to figure out
how to bring it in-house.
- [Voiceover] But the major sources
of re-engagement are Facebook and--
- Oh, you meant in terms
of how much of that
are you re-engaging that customer through,
re-contacting them through
email and re-reaching
them through other channels?
- [Voiceover] Well, there's like multiple
pieces of infrastructure,
(hum drowns out speaker)
- That's just literally buying advertizing
on Facebook or LinkedIn
where you have the ability
to re-target users
X days or Xweeks or months
after they've churned,
and try and convince them to come back
based on specific advertising.
I mean, obviously, you see
it right now with e-commerce
where like you go in overstock
and then three minutes
later on another site,
you're like, that's the
dress that I just looked at!
So that's like how
re-targeting essentially works.
- [Voiceover] So it
seems like SurveyMonkey
hasn't really been aggressive
in penetrating the mobile space,
can you please explain this?
- Sure, we can talk about mobile.
So, as far as the question was,
it doesn't seen like SurveyMonkey
is necessarily been aggressive
about the mobile space.
So, about people taking surveys today,
domestically it's about 35%,
internationally it's about 50%,
who are taking it on a mobile phone.
So it is extremely important
that our experience is
optimized for mobile web.
Those users who are taking surveys
will not be downloading our mobile app.
We have a mobile app that's
both for Android and iOS,
that's been pretty successful,
that is mostly for creating surveys.
But what most people are
doing on the mobile app
is they're really managing their results,
they want to check their
results in real time,
and they want to make quick
fixes and edits on typos,
because we've targeted
our apps at existing users
who are trying to do stuff
as more of a compliment
to the desktop.
The other thing that we also have
is essentially a mobile SDK,
which allows other app developers
to integrate SurveyMonkey
into their apps very easily.
And so, if people want to integrate...
We use it as an example for asking you,
you know, if you click feedback,
if you say you had a very good experience,
then we might suggest
you go to the app store.
And if you had a bad experience
we might try to collect more information.
But it's using surveys in app.
So that's been our mobile strategy.
It is absolutely vital internationally
that you're thinking, especially
on that taking experience for mobile.
But you're not going to get a user
who is doing a none-recurring activity
to download an app.
So you need to ensure
that your experiences
is fantastic on the mobile web.
And I don't know if you've
seen the recent data,
but mobile web is growing
about 2x as fast as mobile apps.
So, there is no question that
that has to be an
important part of anything
that you would build today.
- Actually, a follow-on to that,
which I actually hadn't realized
would be a good question for you
and you may or may not be able to answer,
given I don't know which of
the stuff is confidential.
Obviously, in a macro-sense
there's this interesting
app versus mobile web war
between Apple and Google.
Because iOS is going like,
let's really make it more app,
Android and Google are
making it more mobile web.
Does that play out in SurveyMonkey at all?
- It play out in a different market.
So, as you can see,
certain markets where
iOS is much stronger,
like in US is about 50/50,
but Japan iOS is much stronger.
So where you see more iOS
you then can see more per app downloads
and where Android is
stronger you'll see...
Like we don't see as
much Android app usage,
but we do see a ton of mobile web
coming from Android.
And that's like markets
that are more Android-heavy
we've had less success
in downloading the app.
- Right, next question.
And by the way, we're now at a point
where feel free to just
interrupt with questions.
I have a bunch more, but if you have them.
That class has been
entrepreneurial in asking anyway.
I only have one more critical question,
everything is bonus around.
So, part of your scale-up was
getting the multi-threading,
being able to work on more
than one project at a time.
You have developer tools,
you have the global billing,
you have gone into panels.
What specifically did
you do to start trying
to enable multi-threading on decisioning,
multi-threading on different groups
working separately but also together,
which is one of the really key things
that you begin to set
up as the foundation?
- So, it was very much tied
to the technical architecture,
decision we made to move to a
service-oriented architecture.
And then I believe very
strongly that it's important
that the teams that are working
on any set of the services
have an embedded team of a product leader,
user experience design
leader, QA atomation,
obviously, the engineering leader,
and then, an BI analyst,
who's actually looking
at the data for that part.
If you've built something
you want to understand
how well it did and how well it's doing,
so it's important that
those metrics get fed back.
We basically structure
the team so that you have
these sort of teams that are
working on different services,
or different parts of the app.
And then there's standardization of APIs.
And so how you're talking
to the service's tier is consistent.
So, that becomes important
as you start wanting to add new features
or new products on top
is that figuring out
what are the guard rails
you want to give each team
and what is the freedom
you want to give each team.
And so in our case,
the guard rails we gave
was 100% code-review,
on the services tier,
I think, 80 to 100% unit-task coverage.
And then, API standards.
But we didn't give a basic
that you had to...
We wanted you to release
at least once a week.
But you can release more if you wanted to.
But basically, the thought-process was,
I didn't actually care if people wanted
to do three weeks sprints
or two weeks sprints,
or they wanted to do kind of
semi-waterfall or agile or whatever.
Commit your quarterly road map,
figure out what you
actually want to get done
and give as much freedom
to the team as possible,
but make sure that they're
getting the metrics back
of how things actually
did when it launches.
So I think it's important to do it
24 hour, 7 day and 28 day read-out
of everything that goes live.
But I feel like creating
that embedded team model,
like if you ask someone at
SurveyMonkey engineering,
they will more identify, regardless of
they're product or QA or whatever.
They'll more identify as a gorilla,
which is our analyze team
versus like I'm an engineer.
And I think that that's actually good.
- [Voiceover] So it
seems like SurveyMonkey
is pretty similar to EventPro in terms of
it's a product for organizers to then
distribute their own way.
How do you guys think about
product development given that
there's two sorts of like
user bases creators and the respondents?
- Yeah, so again, whenever you're thinking
about EventPro as the same,
which is whenever you're
thinking about the fact
that that respondent
might become your creator,
like you have to make sure
that the respondent experience
is just like fantastic,
they can take the survey really well,
that's optimized for mobile,
that then when they lend, when they finish
is a good experience.
But if you think about...
And that's 80% of our traffic
is on the taking side.
But obviously our customer,
the one who's paying us,
the one who's putting their faith in us
to actually send their survey out
to the customers as the creator.
So in terms of from the
resourcing perspective
we spend most of our resources
on the survey creation side,
because you need to get that person
through the hurdle of
having the confidence
to like put their name out there
with a bunch of questions
to a bunch of other people.
And that is the customer who essentially
in the end we're trying to upgrade
to get into a paying customer base.
But you have to balance your resources,
but you have to think about
where that entry and starting
point is of that live cycle.
- [Voiceover] Do you guys
spend a lot of effort
on getting the respondents
to become part of like,
not just like the ecosystem,
but also take other people's
surveys or your own?
- So when we launched the panel business,
then you have the ability
to sign up to take surveys
and every time you take a survey
you get 50 cents to charity
and then a creator can buy respondents.
So that was a new business
that we launched in 2013,
using kind of leveraging the fact
that we have all these users
who want to not only necessarily
send surveys to people they know,
but to potential customers,
to do brand research or market research.
And so we leverage the fact that we have
kind of this large traffic
to build out this panel.
And we decided to do 50
cents for charity of choice
versus money because
we wanted to make sure
people weren't BSing it,
like we wanted to make sure
people were answering and
to make sure that answering
was very high quality.
It was really important that, you know,
no one's going to like to BS a survey
to give 50 cents to, you know,
the Teach For America,
so that's why we built it out that way.
Sorry, not that completely
answers your question, but...
- Let's go down the
road, so no, you first.
- [Voiceover] So you
mentioned at some point
that as you scale the organization--
(hum drowns out speaker)
- That's a great question.
- [Reid] And, repeat it.
- Oh, sorry, the question was is that,
you know as a manager
you're trying to figure out
who can essentially scale and grow,
but as a person in the
chair, how do I make sure
that I'm scaling and growing?
I would say, again, a
lot of it is, you know,
is figuring out if you're actually enjoy
people management as it scales and grows.
It's not for everybody.
We put all of our engineers through this
engineering management screen
and we have a very nice
tech track for people too.
And so, you can either scale
through a tech track way
and scaling the tech
track way and growing that
is about gaining knowledge,
taking more ownership
of more services, showing mentoring
other people on the team,
and kind of being able
to take tech leadership.
But then there is also the
people management track.
And you have to really decide
if it's something that you enjoy.
But if you're in that role,
like you've brought somebody in to lead,
then there is a question...
If you think about it, if
you're managing five people
then you're having a 20% impact
on like five different things.
When you're suddenly
managing like 50 people,
you're having a 2% impact
on 50 different things.
And so, you have to be
excited and feel excited
about not necessarily get like,
there is something so
satisfying to like coding
and pushing it to production
and having it work.
Like you have to feel satisfaction
over influencing other people.
And so part of it is like making sure
that that's something you're excited about
and being a good people manager
is about removing road
blocks for your team,
making sure that they're
getting what they need
to get their job done.
And then, making sure that
you're communicating to them
about what's like the most important
things that you're working on.
And so, like that's not
enjoyable to everybody.
So I think that that
also becomes a question,
is also starting to be
honest with yourself
of like what you enjoy.
And then depending upon that,
like working on those skills.
And I'm sure you're going to add to that.
- [Reid] Yeah, other will,
we'll optimize the questions in.
(hum drowns out speaker)
- So the question was,
what the panel can you target
based on specific demographic data?
So, the answer is yes, and we collect it
through a survey, so we ask them.
Which is actually the best way
to collect the data,
and then as a buyer, you can
choose different demographics.
So if you're trying to launch a product
for young women you can target
young women and then ask them.
- Here please.
- [Voiceover] Do you have any plans
entering with the polling space,
survey polling space or similar?
- I don't, did you see me?
Sorry, his question
was if we have anything
in entering the polling space.
Did you watch Meet The Press?
Okay, well, we are polling, yeah.
So we've launched, Mark
Blumenthal signed yesterday,
joined our SurveyMonkey yesterday,
was running Pollstar.com,
we had John Cohen,
who was the head of the
Washington Post Polling.
We were the only company
that correctly called the UK election.
So we basically used the
end of the survey page
as well as our panel,
and we asked a bunch of questions.
And if you think about it,
our sample size is so much larger
than calling people on the phone.
So now we have a partnership with NBC
to poll on certain topics.
And so, it's something that, again,
somebody asked the question around,
how do you think about global
in terms of one of the things
is like the brand awareness side.
If you start thinking
about election and polling,
if we can show
that the data is accurate
and our sample is good,
it helps obviously with
that audience panel,
but it also vastly helps with building
that brand awareness and that confidence
that SurveyMonkey is not just this tool,
but actually is a data business over time.
And building that confidence,
as, you know, what is
your kind of next step
from an innovation perspective
and the polling as an important piece
for that for us.
It's really cool, though.
You should look at the UK article,
it's like pretty exciting.
- [Voiceover] You were saying about,
it was important to do
7 day, 28 day read-outs.
What are those?
- Oh, sorry, I said the
reason we introduced
7 day and 28 day read outs...
With every feature or with
everything that gets built
it's important to say how it did.
And there are some features you built
that didn't work and that's okay.
Like then you have to get rid of it,
because just adding
clutter for the customers
is like not a good idea.
- [Voiceover] Taking a step back
to when you first go in SurveyMonkey,
it seems like there is a
lot that needed to get done
on all aspects of the company.
One thing that Reid talked about
earlier on in these classes
figuring out which fires to let burn,
which ones to put up,
how did you do it?
- So the question was,
there seemed to be a lot to get done,
how do we decide which fires to burn,
which ones to put out.
I'd say we were in a very
advantageous position
in that the business
was doing really well.
So we could take an approach to say,
let's break up the problems.
And I think that is from my perspective
the most important thing.
It's like, what are the problems
that are most important,
which problems can you let go for longer.
And do a lot of it was
collecting customer feedback
and understanding which
parts of the application,
whether it was through a
combination of user testing,
of a combination of looking
at the quantitative data
of what people were doing on the site.
As well as all of the customer feedback
and surveys of our own customers
is understanding what were the pieces
that the customers were telling us
were the most broken.
And so, again, like globally
we saw customers couldn't pay.
That was a huge problem,
because people wanted to use the service.
Then we saw that people
couldn't understand the data.
So focusing on analytics
was the most important.
People actually loved the way
that you could create the survey.
Like the biggest feedback was,
"Oh, this is so easy to
use, it's so easy to use
"to get my surveys started."
That's the last thing we attacked.
So it was very much looking at
both qualitative and quantitative
from our customers to drive
what were those fires.
- [Voiceover] I have a question about--
(hum drowns out speaker)
- So the question was that, you know,
a lot of people recommend
staying here locally
and then I made the
decision to move to London
and how did that affect my career?
So, I did start here, we started Evite
in kind of our dorm, actually,
here at Stanford.
And stayed here for a number of years.
Evite sold to a media
conglomerate called ISC,
which owns Ticketmaster,
Citysearch, Match,
Expedia at the time.
And so, that was down in LA,
so I was in LA for a couple of years.
But for me it was that, you know,
I really wanted to gain that
international experience
and also just on a personal level,
really wanted to live abroad.
And so, maybe if my career decision
may have been better to
come back to the Valley,
it was 2005 and, you
know, join a startup here.
But you have to balance I think
what you really enjoy
personally and professionally.
And on a personal level
it was the best decision
I've ever made, I met my husband, so...
- [Voiceover] You mentioned
the first hire you had
was the user experience designer.
Most people don't find
surveys extremely fun
or very exciting to do, right?
So what kind of changes did you have to do
to make it so that it's
as pleasant as possible?
- So, the question was, you know, surveys,
people don't necessarily find surveys fun,
so how did you make it
as pleasant as possible,
given that we hired the
user experience designer?
So again, a lot of it
was around the creator,
was that how do we get that person
right from that logged out experience,
whether they were coming
in through a search,
or they were coming in
through taking a survey
and drive that person into the funnel.
So how do we even, you
know, on-board them?
Like what are you trying to do?
And trying to help that person
all along that experience.
But as I said, the biggest,
biggest thing we focused on
with the user experience
design perspective
is helping people understand their data.
The more people used our product
to understand the data
that lowers our churn,
so improves our engagement and retention.
So that is a very hard problem.
- [Voiceover] Given that
you're like converted
the technical team from
like two-three engineers
to what it is now,
what was some of the highest leverage,
like organizational
strategies that you used
at the beginning when you got there?
- So, the question was,
given that we moved the
team from two to 150,
what were some of the
organizational strategies
we used to scale, basically?
- [Voiceover] That were
very high leverage,
so something that took minimal effort
through like very big?
- [Reid] That was like
Goldberg hiring you.
- Yeah, I mean there's nothing with hiring
that is a silver bullet.
You have to slog through
hiring each person,
getting them on-board.
I would say one of the things that had
the biggest bank for the
buck was on-boarding,
is like getting people
on-boarded correctly
so they understand the
mission of the company,
and understood what we
were trying to accomplish,
where we were going from
a vision perspective
is one of the most important things that
you can do to get people kick-started
when they're there structurally.
And then I would say, the other thing
that we really liked to do
is that we always liked to have,
the re has to be some cadence
that everybody's agreeing to
that the business should operate.
In our case, we decided on quarterly.
And so, every quarter there was
what are we going to
get done this quarter?
And no matter whether we
were two people or 150 people
we still keep that cadence
where everybody says
this is what we're going
to get done in the quarter.
And I think that starting to build
that in from the beginning
is actually pretty important
because then people get used to that
sort of rhythm of the business
and that helps the organization sort of
know what to expect in some time period.
What you can do goes from this to this,
but it's still the fact that
your communication is...
So every quarter I get
the entire team together
and we quickly go through key
things we did last quarter
and like great things coming up.
- [Reid] I'm going to
ask the last question.
Overtime, but I think
it's still worth asking.
You have a phone line to call yourself,
your younger self six years ago--
- Oh, the beginning of SurveryMonkey.
- [Reid] Yes, what's the
one thing or two things
you would tell yourself to do differently?
I know saved the real
fun moment to the last.
- Yeah, i know, so,
what wold I tell myself to do differently?
So I would say, this is
a very technical thing,
I would say the biggest thing
we didn't do fast enough
was improve our deployment systems.
And I survey my team every single quarter,
and as a team started to scale and grow,
it was the thing that was coming
back in the survey the most.
Which was make sure that
like for us to get our code from keyboard
to production was just too long.
And so, we should have just automated
all of the deployment
systems right from the start.
So I would say that's one of the things
that cost way too much
engineer frustration
that I should have dealt
with at the beginning.
The only thing I also to say is, you know,
I think I did a pretty good job,
but cherished David even more than I did.
- [Reid] Yeah, of course.
Alright, well let's thank Selina for--
(audience applause)
