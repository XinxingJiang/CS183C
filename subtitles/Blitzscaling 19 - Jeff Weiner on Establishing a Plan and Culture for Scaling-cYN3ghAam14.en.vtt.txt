- So it is my pleasure and honor
to introduce Jeff Weiner.
He and I actually have been
hearing about each other
for some number of years
before we finally met.
I think we were actually at a
conference dinner table arranged by Adam
and his folk.
- Boulevard, brainstorming
session Februray 2008. `
No, this was Kirk Patrick days.
- Exactly, and then we
started talking to each other
about how it is that we build these
amazing products and companies
in Silicon Valley and eventually had the
enormous good fortune to work together
not by accident.
So with that, let's open to
so I persuaded you to come
take a look at LinkedIn
and try out LinkedIn and you arrived
and there's roughly 400 people
at the company.
What was the situation on
the ground as you found it?
- So it was December 2008, we had about
338 folks and I found
an incredibly talented
group, not surprisingly,
that Reid and my predecessor
and I had assembled,
and even before my first day
I had already started to
familiarize myself with the company
through Reid, through
some of the investors
that were at Greylock, where
I was in EIR at the time,
and had recognized that
there was much more to it
than met the eye, which is interesting
because to this day, when
people come inside the company
to interview or they want to
talk about where we're headed,
a common response is, wow I had no idea
how much was going on or how
big this could potentially be.
So I found an enormously
talented group of people
and a platform with almost
unlimited potential within
the specific context of creating
value for professionals.
Creating economic opportunity
for a global workforce.
I also found the situation where there,
even though it was 338 people,
there were a lot of different
things taking place.
There were a lot of bets
that had been placed
and Reid, for those of you
who haven't gotten a chance
to know him or first
principles, one of Reid's
first principles is
preserving optionality.
I think it's one of the
reasons he's been so effective
as an investor and it
was one of the reasons
I believe that LinkedIn
reached critical mass
was because of the various
areas in which the company
was investing to see
if they could generate
critical mass and scale.
At some point, though, there comes a time
when you have to ask yourself
essentially the question
if you could only do one
thing, what would it be?
And that's another way of thinking about
how you define your core and at that point
I think there was a good understanding
of the potential avenues
the company could take
in terms of defining its
core, more specifically,
but there was a fair amount
of activity taking place
for a company of that size.
- And so what did you,
cause part of the reason
we open there is not
just the narrative arc,
but it's the scaling arc
because we had gotten to what,
in our language, is essentially a village
and now it's a nation, in
terms of the size of the pace,
and we were not actually
particularly well set up
for really getting the scale.
There were a bunch of different,
kind of, internal things
that we're going to go through
some of the specifics of,
but how did you look at
that from a scale thing?
What were things you said
"this is things I need to do
in the first hundred
days, this is what we need
to be prepped in order to
do, here's how we focus."
Go back to then and think
"Okay, this is what I saw
"and these were my first hundred days
"in terms of what I was doing."
- So the first hundred days
was a lot of listening.
So I had a chance to meet with essentially
every employee of the
company, certainly every team,
either through one on
ones or brown bag lunches.
Then we did a series of deep dives
for every product line and business line
and was just trying to learn
as much as I possibly could
about the company, the team,
the direction it had been
heading, the direction where
people wanted it to go.
So there was a lot of
listening rather than
develop a hundred day plan.
It was make sure I had
a chance to understand
where the people who knew the company best
thought it was going
and where it had been.
At that point, I felt
we were in a position
where we needed to make
some choices and decisions
about defining the core, and based on
my previous experience
at a company like Yahoo,
which was involved in a
lot of different businesses
by design, I mean Yahoo helped organize
the internet for the masses.
That was one of the reasons
Yahoo was able to generate
so much value so quickly,
but in the later years
I think that same advantage,
that same value proposition
that Yahoo had established
became an Achilles's heel
because it was involved in so
many different business lines.
It invites a lot of competition within
each of those verticals and a company
that could focus exclusively on one thing
within that vertical,
say Google and search
or Amazon and eCommerce for example,
I think has a much higher
likelihood of being successful.
So that was one of the
most valuable lessons
I learned while I was at Yahoo
and LinkedIn was the next
company I had the chance
to be a part of, I did
an EIR stint in between,
and I wanted to make sure that we had
a very clear sense of what our core was
and what it was we were
trying to accomplish.
And so one of the first things I did
with a leadership team
was codify our mission,
our vision, our addressable opportunity,
our strategy, our priorities,
our measurable objectives,
our culture and our values.
And while that may sound like a lot,
it's basically how a company
defines its narrative
and it fits all on one page.
And you don't have to
limit yourself to one page
but it's an excellent forcing mechanism
to be able to very clearly and simply
articulate what a company is about,
what it's trying to accomplish,
how it wants to accomplish it.
- So go through a little bit
of what those details are
because that preparation for that scale
was one of the very first
things I learned from you.
- So I guess I would start
with delineating clearly
between mission and vision,
which a lot of companies
have a tendency to use synonymously
and I think it's a lost opportunity.
So for me, a mission is
an over-arching objective
that everyone at a company
can participate in.
It should be measurable and realizable
and hopefully it's inspirational.
So our mission at LinkedIn
is to connect the world's
professionals, to make them
more productive and successful.
And when we talk about
professionals in that context,
we're talking about an
addressable opportunity
of about 780 million knowledge workers
and students, pre-professionals.
The vision is a dream.
It's true north and if it's done properly,
is really designed to inspire people
so they have something to reach for.
And historically, at least
for me, a vision wasn't
necessarily something you operationalize
or something you plan
around, but it does provide
some shared sense of
purpose for an organization.
And one of the things that's
been so fun and exciting
about LinkedIn, and
we'll probably get to it
a little bit later, is that
we're now in a position
where we're trying to
operationalize our vision.
We're trying to operationalize
and manifest our dream,
which I've never been a part of before
and it's pretty cool.
So our vision is to create
economic opportunity
for every member of the global work force.
There's over three billion
people in the global work force.
So that's the vision.
So I'm seeing some hands, do
you go to folks during class?
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I'm
wondering, so a lot of
people talk about vision
and mission being important
to the very core of the
beginning of the company,
how do you know when it's time to either
articulate or do something like that?
Why would you maybe wait
to do that in this case?
- Yeah, because the question's on the mic,
so I'm not as sure about
the question as you.
- Okay, so when do you know it's time
to codify or define mission and vision
and how often do you revisit?
- [Voiceover] Yeah, why wait?
- Why wait, so, I wouldn't wait.
So I think Reid and the
founders of LinkedIn
probably had a pretty clear sense
of where they wanted to take
the company whether or not
it was codified as a
specific mission statement
and remarkably you can go back
and it's on SlideShare,
it's up on LinkedIn,
but you can go back and look at Series B.
- [Reid] Yeah, Series B.
- The Series B deck that
was provided to Greylock.
It's crazy how accurately
Reid and the founders
articulated where they
want to take the company
many, many years down the road.
It's not surprising if you know Reid
and you know the team, but at any rate,
whether or not they actually took the time
to codify a statement, they
had a very clear understanding
of where they wanted to go.
For me, coming out of Yahoo
and having seen that situation,
I just felt it was really
important to define that
as quickly and as early on as possible.
It just so happened that's
when I joined the company
it was at 338 people.
If I was founding the company today,
one of the first things I
would do is codify a mission.
- Actually the key thing to understand is
it wasn't that we didn't
have a mission and vision,
although we didn't articulate them
with that kind of language
that's useful, it's the question
of the format for how it is
you get a common language
across people when you're at
300 people going to 10,000.
That isn't actually as important
to get a common language
when you're 15 people.
Through common language
you're all in the same room.
Hello, we're talking to each other
so that doesn't matter, but
when you're beginning to plan
to get to scale, actually in
fact figuring out how it is
you're going to have 10,000
people on the same language,
that was the thing that
Jeff looked around and said
"Okay, we're not set up for that.
"We may have the mission
and vision in mind
"but we're not set up for that yet."
And that was, like, basically what you did
in the first two months, I think.
- Put another way, when your
organization is 15 people,
and you're essentially
all in the same room,
that's your office.
If you want to have an
all hands and discuss
the direction of the company or revisit
the direction of the company, you say
"Hey everyone can I get you attention?"
That's an all hands.
When you're 150 people, maybe you crowd
everyone into the cafeteria and maybe
you're all in the same floor or not,
at 1500 people spread
across multiple cities,
you don't have that luxury.
And so things like your mission
statement, your strategy,
your target audience, your
core value proposition,
your culture and your
values aren't codified,
nature abhors a vacuum.
And so do strong leaders.
And so they will project into the vacuum
what they bring to the
table, and their own wants
and dreams and desires and that's how
hyper growth companies can
start to go off the rails,
is that you don't have clarity
around your sense of purpose,
what you're trying to
accomplish and how you want
to accomplish it, and so
people start to project
into that vacuum the way they
think things should be done.
And it becomes very difficult
to keep a group of people
on the same page as you achieve
greater and greater scale that way.
- So let's shift to culture,
because actually I think
one of the, if you look at some of the arc
of how you've, you know,
some implicit things
in terms of what Eric Schmidt said,
some very explicit things
Reed Hastings said,
some of the things that
Brian Chesky was saying,
actually in fact--
- It's quite a lineup you've had in here.
- Yes, yes.
- I should be attending the class.
- (laughs) But actually
in fact, one of the,
the visible but not often
commented on secrets
of how it is Silicon Valley
companies achieve strong scale
is actually, they all
have some strong culture.
They define it differently,
they implement it differently,
but that creation of
culture, which creates
a horizontal norm across
the various people,
and so therefore you're
not completely beholden
to vertical command
structures as a way of your
expanding your bandwidth and
your capacity organization.
The culture is one of the
key glues that does that.
And that's actually one of the things
that is a key part of the scaling,
so you get there, we have a culture
but we haven't actually
really defined it in a way
to grow, what are the things
that you started doing
to put a culture in place
that would enable scale?
- So I think it starts with having
a shared understanding of what culture is.
So that could be a Rorschach test.
So we had a shared understanding.
I believe culture is the
collective personality
of an organization, and it's not only
who you are, but who you aspire to be.
And the aspirational
component is critical.
If you don't have the
aspirational component
baked in to the culture,
what happens is you start
to define the cultural
dimensions of the company
and if you're not
constantly walking the walk
on those dimensions,
then when the leadership
gets up in front of the company and starts
presenting the culture,
people are rolling their eyes
and they start cracking jokes
about the fact that it's
all kind of BS, becomes
like a Dilbert comic strip.
When you factor in this
notion of aspiration,
it provides and gives
the company permission
to not necessarily constantly
be doing everything
that it ultimately wants
to do, there's that
aspirational component,
which is we want to reach
and ultimately become
that kind of company.
I think that's a really
important part of it.
I would also clearly draw a distinction
between culture and values, which again
some companies have a
tendency to use synonymously,
and values are nested within a culture.
Values help a company
to define its culture
and values, for me, are
the operating principles
upon which a company and its leadership
make day to day decisions.
So there's culture and there's values.
By the time I joined
LinkedIn, at about 330 people,
340 people, there was an increasing demand
for the culture and the first time
I was asked that question,
I probably just made a joke,
cracked a joke, like
a Dilbert comic strip,
because at the companies
I'd been at previously,
it wasn't necessarily something that was
of great focus, where a
lot of energy was placed,
and as the CEO of the company, I started
getting asked that question more often,
more and more increasingly which was
what's our culture, and as
I reflected on why people
were asking, I realized it
comes back to the same concept
that we talked about a moment ago,
which is nature abhors a vacuum,
and when you don't have a codified culture
and you start to reach
this level of scale,
you're hiring increases, the
rate of hiring increases,
and at some point you're going
to be hiring and recruiting
people from companies that
have already achieved scale
and there going to bring
their own cultural baggage
from the companies that they worked at,
where they were inculcated
and they figured out
how to do things, and if
the company doesn't have
a codified culture, they're
going to start manifesting
whatever the culture they've learned
and they're coming with.
This is particularly important when you're
trying to expand globally
and you're setting up
new offices that aren't in the same place
as the headquarters, and
you want to make sure
that the leadership that's
setting up the offices
in these remote locations
are good cultural actors
because if that's not the case,
they will set up the office
with their own culture and where they want
to take the company, and
that's a very good way
of leading to a bad outcome.
So, interestingly enough,
there had already been
an exercise underway
when I joined the company,
a bottoms up exercise
which I thought was really interesting,
that a guy named Arvind Rajan,
who had lead our talent efforts,
he was working on a project
where he had identified a few employees
and was asking them
about values and culture.
So when I got there, I
wanted that work to continue
and I sat down with the leadership team
and we started talking about
the kind of organization
we wanted to be a part of
and what kind of personality
we collectively believe
that the company should be
manifesting and espousing.
And we wanted to make
sure that it was the kind
of organization that we
would aspire to work at
and that we would be inspired by.
And so there was a fair
amount of time spent
on word-smithing and
getting that stuff right.
Words have power, especially when you are
laying the foundation for
an organization like this.
With regard to values, I find that
organizations that have
the most effective values
are those where the leadership,
the founders, they are
using as values the things
they find themselves, the
mantras they find themselves
using most often, because
what's critical in terms
of manifesting culture and
values is walking the walk.
So, it's easy to talk about this stuff
and it's easy to paint your
walls with your culture
and values and hand out mouse pads
and those lamented cards
you stick in your wallet,
but at the end of the
day, if the leadership
of the organization is not
modeling this behavior,
if you're not recruiting people against
you're culture and values,
on boarding against it,
developing your talent
against it and evaulting
performance against it, that stuff's
really not worth the
paper it's printed on.
And so you want to make
sure that you've got buy in
from your leadership,
that they believe in it,
that they're going to model the behavior,
that they're reinforcing
it and you also have
buy in from your broader employee
base that also feels like
they were a part of defining that culture
and defining those values.
- And so, one key part
of this is leadership.
So part of, again, one
of the things you started
pretty quickly doing and insisting,
how do you develop leaders?
Like what are the, who are
the key leaders going to be?
Are they going to, are we going to define
and fit a culture that will then become
a horizontal norm, but
also let's create a way
that leaders are improving,
we have second bench of leaders,
how did you approach the, how do we grow
leadership within a company
as we're gonna scale?
- So I guess it begins
with recognition that
two of the most important
continuums an organization
leadership team need to
navigate as they achieve
critical mass and scale
are first, this idea
that there's a continuum
with problem solving
on the one end and coaching on the other.
And a second continuum where
you have tactical execution
on one end and you have proactive
strategy on the other end.
And when cultivating and
developing a leadership team,
one of the first things
you that you need to do
is make sure the leadership
understands the importance
of coaching, and what happens
is, more often than not,
a startup, say, with
15 people is successful
because the founders and
those founding employees
are really good at solving
problems and getting shit done.
And so as the orginization
continues to scale,
they knee-jerk to that
aptitude, they knee-jerk
to that skill set.
After all, it's one of the
reasons they've been successful.
But as you're adding people
into the organization,
as soon as they experience a problem,
they come to you as a leader
and if you're knee-jerking
is solving the problem
for them, the next time
they experience the
problem, what do you think
they're going to do?
They're going to come right back to you.
And so if you can take
the time to start to
evolve along that continuum
and recognize the fact
that you have a great
skill at solving problems,
but you need to really invest
in coaching other people
to solve the problems for themselves,
that's where you start
to achieve real scaled
leadership level, and it gets even better
when you can coach others
to coach their teams.
That's when you achieve true scale.
Separately, you've got tactical execution
and proactive strategic thinking
and that requires time.
So to make that shift, you know,
executing is something that
teams get really good at
as they are achieving success,
otherwise they wouldn't
be having that success, and
you have to carve out cycles,
you have to, I like to
bake in about 90 minutes
of buffer time in my daily
schedule, and that's time
where I can catch my
breath, I can connect dots,
I can synthesize, I can
catch up, I can have
extemporaneous discussions,
that's time where I can start
to think proactively, and if
you're not carving out the time
to think proactively, it's
going to be really difficult
to lead the organization
because you're going to be
constantly firefighting
and constantly reacting.
So you want to be able
to take the time to start
to think ahead and so you
can lead the organization
in that direction as
opposed to, unfortunately,
playing catch up with your competitors,
because once you start playing their game
and reacting to their moves,
it's basically game over.
So both of these
continuums require a shift
when you're a 15 person
company and what it takes
to be successful as a 15 person company,
you better be good at problem solving
and getting shit done.
That's a huge part of it.
You have a vision, you have a concept,
you got to build the
prototype, you got to raise
the finance, you got to hire the team,
I mean it'a boom, boom, boom.
As you start to get bigger,
as you start to reach
that kind of scale of critical
mass, you need to start
to begin that evolution to cross those,
at least those two continuums.
- And one of the things that actually
kind of surprised me as something
that would never occur to me,
you actually hired some
coaches into the company.
So why don't you say a little bit,
'cause that was the kind of thing, like,
precisely kind of the thing a start-up guy
would go, "That's insane,
this isn't a person
"who's building a product
that we're shipping,
"what the heck are we
hiring this person for?"
- It just goes back to the same concept.
You know, coaching,
I've been at companies where you bring in
coaches, or you bring in HR experts,
or I mean, we've all been there
and it's an eye rolling experience
and it doesn't feel
like it's worth the time
and the last thing in the world a start-up
that's just going wants to do
is bring somebody in to
do that kind of stuff.
But if you want to successfully scale,
you're going to need a leadership team
underneath you whose going
to help you make that happen.
Otherwise, you're not going to be able
to execute at scale.
And once you begin to
recognize the importance
of coaching, of
mentorship, of development,
of understanding and taking the time
to understand what someone
wants to accomplish
with their career, their
hopes, their dreams,
their fears, their insecurities,
their vulnerabilities,
you can start to play to their strengths.
You can start to compliment those areas
where they need help.
And that requires time and it requires
people that know how to coach
and if you're fortunate enough,
you'll have a leadership team
that inherently is good at coaching.
I think you would be,
I think it would be an
unusual set of circumstances
where an organization
that is just in the throws
of scaling would find
themselves in a situation
where they couldn't benefit
from professional coaches.
And so in our case, one example would be
a guy named Fred Kaufman, who wrote a book
called Conscious Business,
and I had a chance
to meet Fred at Yahoo, he
was brought in to help,
and it was one of those situations where
I expected an eye rolling experience.
As a matter of fact, I
don't even think I went
to the first session that I was supposed
to go to, and members of my team came back
and said, "This guy's
amazing," and they gave me
a handout that had been, I think it was
an excerpt from the book,
and it stayed on my desk
for a while and at some
point I actually remember
flipping through it and I
was like, this is different,
and eventually the executive team at Yahoo
was encouraged to spend
some time with Fred
together and I was extremely impressed
and we just developed a friendship.
I consider him a mentor, and so he's been
enormously influential
on my career ambitions
and what I'm hoping to
accomplish in the way
he's provided some feedback
and guidance there.
And at one point, I just
invited him to join LinkedIn
and to be a part of
our team and he thought
he was done ever working
for a company again,
but I think the platform
is so uniquely positioned
to help Fred accomplish
what he wants to do,
which is, for lack of a
better term, open-sourcing
his wisdom and his
experience and the things
that he's written about and sharing that
with the professional world,
which he's in a position
to do uniquely on LinkedIn.
So, that would be an
example, and he's been,
as you know, he's been invaluable.
- [Voiceover] Hey, Jeff?
Yeah?
- [Voiceover] So a lot of
these people wouldn't have had
professional coaches in their careers,
'cause a lot of them are students?
And you say, well this
guy was really different,
can you say different from what?
Can you say what it was different--
- Yeah, thanks John.
So, the way I have
described Fred in the past,
so he was, he studied
economics at Berkeley,
ended up at MIT, I think--
- He was a Prof at MIT.
- He was a professor at MIT, I
believe he taught accounting,
he ended up doing a bunch of work
in organizational development.
He is like a Buddhist libertarian
and I don't know that he would officially
describe himself as
either of those things,
but if you think about first
principles in Buddhism,
compassion and things of that
nature and you think about
libertarian ideals in terms
of thinking about systems
and the way systems can maximize value,
you combine that with
his economics background,
he's about the most enlightened
person I've met in business.
I've really never used
that word with anyone else
I've worked with.
He's enlightened.
I know of no other way to describe Fred
and it will be difficult
for you to fully appreciate
what I'm describing
until you meet with him,
and then you'll sit down with him
and he'll start talking and
about 10 minutes in to it
you're like "Whoa, that's. (laughs)
"Can you say that again?"
Every time I've spent
time with Fred, literally,
without exception, every time
I've spent time with Fred
I have learned something
that changes my perspective
in some way, great or small.
How many people can you say that of?
So, he's very unusual in
that respect, very unusual.
He's not a, he's not a traditional coach
in that respect.
Interestingly enough, he founded a firm
called Axialent, which
was designed to help
coach leaders and he
wanted to change the way
the business world operated
by virtue of working
with the leadership
teams of these companies
for maximum scale, and hopefully help
these leaders to become more conscious
and more mindful.
It's been a lot of fun working with him,
we're very fortunate to
have him at the company.
- One way to understand, kind of,
run-of-the-mill coaches
and Fred, who is unique,
as a difference is typically
run-of-the-mill coaches go,
here's how I try to give you energy,
like yeah, you can solve that problem,
let me reflect confidence to
her or let me listen to you
and then you solve the problem yourself.
That kind of thing.
Fred actually approaches
it trying to give you
conceptual tools in
order to solve problems.
So for example, one of the tools that Fred
added to his tool chest
as a function of coming
to work for you is that one of the things,
the final thing you said
to him that got him to
get off, he was basically on
a sailboat in the Caribbean,
which is what he was
planning on spending all,
he still does a lot of
free diving, doing that
was he said "Okay I guess
I'll come work for you."
You said, "Don't come work for me,
"work for the mission."
He was like, yes, actually
that's the definition
of good leadership because
you're not actually
creating a personality
cult, you're actually
saying we're all working
for this mission together
and that's exactly the
kind of conceptual tool
that every leader should
use when they're trying
to chart out creating a culture, right?
And so hey says oh, I got to
write something about that.
- I'll give you another example, Mike.
One of our favorites that
those of us at the company
use quite a bit, so I'll make this
a little interactive, so
it's in the context of
global maximum versus local maximum.
And it's virtually an unsolvable equation
in terms of how do you get people
within an organization to lift themselves
outside of their respective
area, their functional area,
for example, their business line to try to
maximize value for the overall company.
It's a really, really
challenging thing to solve for,
so in all of the time
he spent with a lot of
great companies, some of
the most valuable companies
in the world, no one's ever
really been able to solve it,
and so at this point
it's not about solving
that equation, it's about doing it better
than your competition.
So the way in which
Fred tries to get across
how challenging this can
be, or at least the concept
is as follows.
So, any soccer fans in here in the class?
All right, wow.
Just out of curiosity, any NFL fans?
I'm doing a straw pull now.
Any baseball fans?
Oh, for some reason all sitting here,
there's a cluster of baseball fans
around John Lilly.
So, with regard to soccer, what is
the job of the goalie?
For those of you that know soccer,
you can explain it to someone,
what's the job of the goalie?
What is that?
- [Voiceover] Managing the ball.
- [Voiceover] Manning the defense line.
- Preventing the ball from?
- [Voiceover] Entering the goal.
- Entering the goal, that's a very
formal way of describing it, okay.
What were you saying?
- [Voiceover] To manage the defense line.
- Manage the defense line, okay,
another one of the
responsibilities of the goalie.
Any one else?
No one else wants to?
What's that?
- [Voiceover] Provide
confidence to the team.
- Provide confidence for
the team, okay, yeah.
- [Voiceover] Start the offense.
- Start the offense with
the outlet pass, yep.
Yeah?
- [Voiceover] Usually,
the goalie is the captain
for a lot of teams so they're sort of like
the lead from behind.
- Okay, captain, lead from behind.
Anyone else? What's that?
- [Voiceover] Win?
- Have you ever heard
this exercise before?
- [Voiceover] From Allen.
(laughing)
The reason I ask is because no one's ever
gotten it right who
hasn't heard it before.
- [Voiceover] I didn't get
it right the first time.
- No one does, no one does, we all say
exactly what you, I mean this is a pretty
sophisticated group, that
was a great set of answers.
It's usually prevent the
other team from scoring.
So I like how nuanced
the responses were here.
The goalie's job is the same as the other
10 players on the field,
it's to win the game.
If the goalie's job is
to prevent the other team
from scoring, then they're gonna be
really interesting in their statistics
in preventing goals.
Their job is to win the game.
If that means the other team scores
but they can some how
help out in other ways
so that their team scores more goals,
that's what they should be doing.
And it's the same for
every player on the field.
And as soon as you start to think your job
is solely and exclusively focused on your
responsibilities that
pertains to your position,
that's local maximum.
And if that's the way all
11 players on the field
are playing, you know what
the outcome's gonna be.
But when a coach gets a group of people
buying into a program and a philosophy
like a John Wooden, a Mike Krzyzewski,
you know, some of the Nick Saban,
amazing things happen
and you get teams that win and win and win
because they buy into the program.
They're buying into something
bigger than themselves.
And for us, it's that sense of purpose.
And you know Jeff Beisel
just likes to talk
about the difference between missionaries
and mercenaries.
It's another way of
talking about this idea
of an individual maximizing
value for themselves
and seeing the world through their lens
versus being the part, of being a part
of something bigger than themselves.
So that's an example
of the kind of insight
that Fred brings to the
table, and it's unusual
for a coach to be that
insightful that often.
- And since we're on
Fred, let's go to this,
we ordered the questions for this one,
let's go to compassionate management
because Fred's book Conscious Business,
high priest of capitalism,
but compassionate management.
The Buddhism and the libertarianism
is also something that you
essentially take to heart
in scaling an organization.
So compassionate management, what is it,
why is it important, how
does it help you scale?
- Yeah, so I'll start
by describing a story.
It was a personal experience that I had
which is when I decided to aspire
to a first principle of
compassionate mangement.
And then we can talk a little
bit about the definition
and why I believe it's so
important and so valuable.
So, many years ago, I worked for someone,
I was part of their staff
meeting and our boss,
as a team, was growing
increasingly frustrated
with one of the team members who was
a really good person and brought a lot
to their role but didn't
do the role the way
the boss wanted them to do the role.
And so our boss got really
frustrated with them
and the frustration came
across and manifested itself
in, kind of, this passive
aggressivity where there were
jokes made at my colleague's expense
and you could sense
how frustrated our boss
was becoming with this person.
And it was undermining the
boss more than anything else.
And it created a lot of
discomfort in the room
whenever it would happen.
And it wasn't constant,
but it happened enough
that it was uncomfortable.
So during a one on one that I
had with my boss, my manager,
on one particular
occasion I said you know,
the next time you grow
frustrated with our colleague,
rather than make a joke at their expense,
rather than, kind of, express frustration
and raise your voice, you
should go find a mirror
and yell at yourself
because that person's in
the role as a result of you.
It's your choice whether or
not they're doing that job,
it's your choice as to how
they approach their job,
if you don't like the way
they're doing their job,
you can coach them to do it differently.
You can play to their
strengths, you can put them
in another role, you can
transition them out of the company.
But you leaving them in this
role when you're increasingly
frustrated, that's on you.
And so he thought about it
and said let me give that
some consideration, a couple
weeks later he came back
and he said I gave it a lot of
thought and want to thank you
because you were right, that's
exactly what I was doing
and I'm going to change the
way I'm approaching them,
I'm going to play to
this person's strengths.
And as he was saying this, I
realized I was doing the exact
same thing to someone on my team.
I mean the exact same thing.
And in that moment I said I need to
manage more compassionately,
I need to put myself
in the shoes of the people
that I'm working with.
I need to see the world through their lens
and their perspective.
I need to coach them
where I can coach them,
I need to play to their
strengths, I need to understand
what it is that they're
trying to accomplish,
I need to understand
what it is that triggers
their insecurities or
their vulnerabilities
and by virtue of being in
the role that I was in,
that was my responsibility.
I say aspire to manage compassionately
because it's really hard
because to truly be compassionate,
first of all I'm not talking
about conditional compassion,
so after I'll talk about
this with a team, often times
they'll come back in a few weeks and say
so I've got this down when
it comes to the people
I really like working with,
but there's this member of the team
I don't really like at all
and I'm having trouble.
And compassion is not conditional.
That's when it's required
most, is when there's people
that you don't see eye to eye with.
And it's challenging because
we get triggered so easily.
We'll be in a discussion with someone,
they may say something that we
feel like is too aggressive,
you become defensive,
you put it back on them,
and before you know it the
whole thing's escalating.
And often times, in those
situations, rather than assume
nefarious intention,
which is what a lot of us
have a tendency to do when
we've been triggered, when we
become emotional, we just
assume the other person's being
territorial or political or
out to get us or trying to
insult us, when they
could be having a bad day.
Or you may have said something
that triggered something
that they experienced long
before they ever worked with you.
Or maybe you're talking about
something that they're not
as knowledgeable about
and so they start to feel
a little bit insecure.
There's a litany of reasons the
person may be on the attack.
And when you start to feel
that emotion to the extent
you can become a spectator
to your own thoughts,
especially when you become emotional,
which is very, very
challenging but doable,
then you can start to
ask yourself why are you
responding this way,
what's triggering you,
and where are they coming from.
You can put yourself in
their shoes, see the world
through their lens, and
you'll be amazed at the extent
to which you can change the
direction of that discussion
and that conversation or
that potential argument.
One thing that's important to note here
is that there's a difference
between compassion and empathy,
which most people, in at
least Western society,
have a tendency to use synonymously.
Empathy is feeling what
another person feels.
Compassion is a more
objective form of empathy
where you see the world
through their lens,
you understand how they feel
and then you're in a position
to do something about it
so that you can alleviate
their suffering, for example,
if they're suffering.
And the way the Dalai Lama
describes this is this really
powerful visualization, not
that it will ever happen
to any of us here in Silicon
Valley, but if you were
walking along a mountain
trail and you came upon
someone who had a boulder on their chest,
and felt this sense of suffocation,
the empathetic repsonse
would be to feel the same
sense of suffocation,
which would render you helpless.
Now you're experiencing
what they're experiencing,
The compassionate response is to recognize
that they're suffering,
that they're suffocating,
maybe that happened to
you at some point, and to
actually do everything within your power
to alleviate that suffering,
to take the boulder
off their chest, and that's a
really fundamental difference
and often times you hear
people talking about
the importance of being
empathetic and empathy
is certainly a fundamental
building block in terms
of compassion, recognizing
what another person's feeling,
but you want to be able to
maintain that space so you can
actually do something about it.
That's part of the key.
So this all goes into this concept
of managing compassionately
and I think if organizations
can learn to do this at scale,
it's a complete game changer.
- And how, first, two
sub questions on this.
First one is how does
compassionate management
help you get the scale?
How does it help you
navigate the progression
to a scale organization?
- That's a great question.
So, I've never been asked
about it specifically
in the context of scale.
So I think it comes back
to this notion of coaching
and how organizations that
successfully scale are investing
in their leadership and
helping their leaders
lead their teams and helping
them coach their teams
so that they can lead without
them being in the room.
And to the extent you can start
to manage compassionately,
you are reducing conflict.
And every time there's a
conflict, there's gonna be churn
and the resolution of that
conflict, the reconciliation
of at least two parties that
aren't on the same page.
It takes a lot of time and a
lot of cycles and over time,
if that conflict continues to
build, if it's not resolved,
it corrupts the foundation
upon which people are building
their relationship and
a huge part of scaling,
and we've talked about this
quite a bit, in my opinion
a huge part of successfully
scaling, I'm talking about
some of the most valuable
companies in the world,
is trust amongst the
leaders and trust amongst
the employees of that organization
who've worked together
over time, that have each other's
backs, that have developed
a sense of shorthand with one another.
They can, to some extent,
predict how someone's
gonna respond to certain situations.
And it is beyond a competitive
advantage when you've got
that kind of trust, when you
have that kind of shorthand
and compassion helps develop that.
Compassion helps reinforce the fact
that we're all on the same team.
That we're all in this trying
to realize the same mission,
the same vision, manifest and execute
against the same strategy.
So that's where I think
it can be a game changer.
- I think this answers the second part,
but I'm gonna ask it anyway just in case
there's anything you would add, which is
how does, most people, when they hear
compassionate management
tend to think squishy-feely,
people like you because
you're being compassionate,
they think it tends to be a
distraction away from a focus
on results, and actually
a competitive advantage
in winning games, so that's
part of the reason why they
tend to discount it, because
they tend to have this
model of no action, in fact
unless you're just totally
barbaric about going for
results, nothing else matters.
But actually in fact
compassionate management
helps get to results.
And some of that you just
covered, but if there was anything
you wanted to add to that,
that was actually one of things
I thought was a useful
lens that most people don't
frequently think about on this.
- I mean, at the end of the
day, I think one of the most
important drivers of
long term value within
an organization is the speed and quality
of its decision making.
And you'll look back on
companies that have created
outsized value and they're
going to be able to count
on one, two hands the number
of decisions that changed
the trajectory of that company.
The challenge is that that's
retrospectively that they can
identify which decisions those were.
When you cultivate
trust, when you cultivate
compassionate management, you put yourself
and your team in a
position where you can be
making high quality decisions faster.
When you're not being compassionate,
you're constantly thinking
about why somebody
has the intention or the
motivation that they do.
Why they disagree with you.
You know, where they're
coming from, what they're
trying to accomplish at your expense.
And you start to multiply
that through an organization
of hundreds, if not thousands, of people
and you can do the math.
I mean, it becomes
prohibitively expensive in terms
of the cycles that could
otherwise be spent trying to fight
against the competitor,
or trying to make a more
informed decision or a
better decision, or revisit
a decision or learn and grow.
So I think it just builds
a very strong foundation
regardless.
Reid mentioned another
really important point
that's worth calling
out, which is this idea
that compassion is a soft
skill, or it's touch-feely
or it's an eye roller,
this new age concept.
The strongest people I know
are the most compassionate.
True, unconditional
compassion requires almost
superhuman strength and self-confidence
and a sense of who you are
and not allowing other people
to get you to question that
and not falling prey
to vulnerabilities or
insecurities and those triggers,
but rising above it and putting yourself
in the other person's shoes.
I'll give you another
example of where it requires
real strength, and one of the
most common questions I get
is if you're managing
compassionately, how do you ever
let anyone go?
That's not a compassionate thing to do.
It turns out, when someone's
struggling in their role,
the least compassionate thing you can do
is have them stay in the role.
And for those of you that
have ever worked at a company
or been in business, and
you've seen someone struggle,
it's actually a really
difficult thing to watch
because they lose their self-confidence,
they lost their sense of
self and they start to become
a shadow of who they used to be.
And that energy builds on itself.
And they are taking that
energy to their team,
they become less effective,
you become less effective
by virtue of letting that
person remain in that role
and they're taking that
energy home to their families.
And so, by virtue of trying
to turn the other way
and allow that to persist
because you don't want to make
a hard decision, you make
it worse and you increase
that person's suffering.
So in that particular instance,
the most compassionate
thing you can do, A, you
could try to help them
learn the skills they need
and provide the coaching
they need to be effective in the role.
But to the extent that's not possible,
you want to transition
them out as gracefully
and constructively and
compassionately as possible.
And for anyone that thinks
that's a touchy-feely thing,
or a soft skill, try it
some time because it's one
of the hardest things
you'll ever do as a manager.
- [Reid] So, um.
- Yeah, a question?
- [Reid] Oh, yeah?
- [Voiceover] How does
compassionate management fit with
diversity on multiple levels,
not just ethnic and racial,
but like, how do you get people
that grew up in a certain
socio or historical
context to move beyond that
and engage in a compassionate
relationship with people
that have a very different
understanding of the world?
- So I think, in part through
experience, and I think
what you just articulated
is one of the most important
reasons to be building
diverse and inclusive teams.
So you can learn more
about how other people
see the world.
And if you're surrounding
yourself with a homogenous way
viewing things, you're never
going to be in a position
where you can better
understand someone with
a different perspective.
And, you know, we were
talking earlier about
one of the most important
things you can do to maximize
long term value is make high
quality decisions quickly
or with speed and to
make the right decisions,
you want the right
people around the table.
You want people who
are going to poke holes
or play devil's advocate
and shine a light on things
you never could have imagined
or envisioned by virtue
of their own experiences
that compliment your own.
And if you're just surrounded
with clones and mini-mes,
you're all gonna be saying the same thing.
It creates this cacophony
of oneness, or sameness,
and you'll have no
chance to be competitive
in that situation.
So there's a guy on my team,
a guy named Mike Gamson
and he was saying he's not
interested in building out
a diverse team because it's en
vogue or it's the right thing
to do, he's interested in
diversity because he likes to win.
You know, I thought that was a great line.
- And actually, as much as
I like the phrase that I've
never heard before, cacophony of oneness.
- [Jeff] I just made that
up, just came up with that.
- I like the phrase, actually in fact,
part of the whole question
is usually in winning
you actually have to be highly adaptive
and if you don't have some
diversity of skill set
and perspective that is
communicating and collaborating well
together, usually you will
not adapt to some curve
that's coming.
Now, it's not universal
adaptives to everything,
but it's a, essentially like a battle line
of some diversity of
skill sets, knowledge,
reflexes and then cross
coordination and collaboration
in order to figure out how do we adapt,
how do we learn as an
organization in order
to solve this problem.
- [Voiceover] Especially
when you put skill
on like a global level,
right, we have cultural
and like cultural norms about labor
right, and the relationship between them.
- Yeah, and that's why the culture
was the first part of
this, because it's the
cross connection and
then it's a question of
okay, how do you get that culture to also
be highly performant in
adapting and scaling.
- And how do you allow for subcultures
to develop in a constructive way?
So you were just mentioning this idea
of managing a global organization,
we're in 30 cities around the world.
When you travel to any LinkedIn city
anywhere in the world, you
know you're at LinkedIn.
It's really special.
I think it's an enormous
competitive advantage.
You also know you're in Mumbai,
or you're in Beijing, or you're in London
because there is this
sense of allowing these
local cultures to flourish as well.
And the same holds, it's an interesting
metaphor for us as
individuals and employees.
So we want to continue to build towards
this over-arching culture
that we've defined
for ourselves at
LinkedIn, but we also want
to celebrate individuality
and we want to celebrate
diversity and we want
to celebrate the things
that make us different.
And you've got to constantly be striving
for that balancing act.
- So shifting back to these questions,
great question, so what did you track
as changing at LinkedIn when you went
from 338 people to a
thousand to five thousand
to 10 thousand, and as a partial prompt,
how did your sense of how
you use communications
internal of the company?
How did that change and what was the
evolution of that tool as
a way of keeping a unified,
you know, focus and set
of priorities and actions?
- So, the change part
comes back to something
that we described and discussed earlier,
which is this notion of connective tissue
and communication as
an organization scales.
So when you're all in the same room,
it's much easier compared
to when you're in
30 cities around the world.
So one of the devices
that I think we've used
to great effect, and
it's not just anecdotal,
we do an employee voice survey,
we've been doing it bi-annually now for
many, many years and one of the things
that consistently scores
the highest is the fact
we do an all-hands every other week.
So I do an all-company
all-hands every other week.
It started, literally in the cafeteria.
We got all 338 employees together,
and today it is broadcast to all 30 cities
in which we operate and if teams are not
in time zones where
they can watch it live,
they tape it and they
get together and they do
a happy hour at the end of the week.
And in that all-hands, we focus on
our priorities, our operating priorities.
And we walk through what's happening
at the company, for better and for worse.
And it's completely transparent.
And that device has proven to be
invaluable in terms of the repetition
necessary to ensure we're
all on the same page
with regard to the
narrative, mission, vision,
value prompts, etc.
Shining a light on the
things that are working
so we can leverage best in
the straight up practices,
so we can celebrate what's working,
so we can provide the
right kind of recognition
and gratitude, and
perhaps most importantly
to identify when things are not working
so we can get everyone in the company
chipping in and trying to help figure out
how we can improve those situations,
how we can learn from them.
So I think the all-hands
has been invaluable.
The biggest change that
I've noticed at various
inflection points that
probably would not be
too far afield from the numbers that you
threw out and one of the most
valuable lessons I've
learned and one of the most
important values that we have
that needs to be reinforced
is what we describe as
acting like an owner.
And I believe the most
successful companies
at scale are companies
where individual employees
talk about the challenges
the company faces
or the opportunities
the company faces as we
and not the company.
And when they start to
get frustrated or bothered
by something, and a
company that's going to
ultimately, I think, inevitably
experience challenges,
they're gonna say why does the company
do it this way?
As if the company is
something in the distance,
it's this faceless bureaucratic machine
and it's not them.
We're the company, the
leadership runs the company.
I'm not talking about
me or even my directs,
I'm talking about the
people underneath them
constantly reminding our vice presidents
that they run the company
day in and day out.
And it's important to remind them of that
because they're each
going to project their own
baggage from when they
worked at large companies
where they didn't feel like
they were a part of things,
where they didn't feel like
they could change the direction
of the company, and I
vowed that if I was ever
in a position where I was
ultimately responsible
for a company, that people
would always feel like
they could make a difference,
no matter how big we got.
And so reinforcing that, it's inevitable.
You go from, I mean make up the numbers,
you go from 100 to 500
to 1,000 to 5,000, etc.,
and at each one of
those inflection points,
you can just feel it.
I mean it's tangible.
People start to feel
like it's this machinery
that's beyond their control,
when it's not, ever.
As soon as you start to think
it's beyond your control,
guess what happens, it's
beyond your control.
As soon as you start
to think like a victim,
and not like someone who can ultimately
influence the outcomes,
that's exactly what
you become.
So if you can flip that
model, and it's not just about
saying this, it's about reinforcing that
it's the way it works,
where people then feel like
they can express the things
that they're frustrated about,
they can come forward with solutions
and you will practice those solutions.
You'll execute against those ideas.
That reinforces the fact
that we're all owners.
We're all stakeholders,
this is our company,
it's we.
So I think that's an
important recognition.
- I think that's probably,
unless there was something
you wanted to add to the building LinkedIn
to a global company, I just figure 'cause
I think we covered that,
what are the unique lessons
that you've encountered from LinkedIn
being a combination of both a consumer
and an enterprise company having both
aspects to it?
- One, if you an pull
it off, it's fantastic.
Very high degree of
difficulty because that's not
one thing, it's two things.
And the more quote on quote "things"
you try do to as a company, the higher
the degree of difficulty.
And it's probably
exponential at some point
in terms of the, each incremental thing
you add to the company.
It's just that many more
things you need to communicate,
that many more things
people need to internalize
in grok, that many more things people need
to execute against, it
just creates more and more
room for error.
So in a perfect world,
your company would only
produce one thing and it would do it
with the smallest team possible
and it's just easier.
It's just not realistic if you're going to
continue to scale.
Although, times have changed.
I mean, you see what WhatsApp was capable
of doing and before that, Instagram, and
Mark seems to have a
pattern developing here
where he's acquiring
these kinds of companies.
So things have changed, it
doesn't require the same
number of resources, the
same amount of capital
to achieve certain
scale, it doesn't require
the same portfolio approach to achieve
certain kinds of scale by
virtue of technologies,
by virtue of how global
the world has become
and interconnected.
But, if you're going to try
to do more than one thing,
it goes back to knowing
who you are, what you're
trying to accomplish, and that
starts with your narrative.
We are the stories that we tell.
So storytelling is the oldest known
form of communication, right?
Cave drawings, and that's just innate.
It's just part of who
we are as human beings.
And we communicate through narrative.
So your mission, your
vision, your strategy,
your value prop, your
culture, your values,
that's an organization's narrative.
And you need to define that and codify it
and reinforce it and one of
the most important things
that we've reinforced from very early on,
recognizing that we are
trying something with
a higher degree of difficulty,
an enterprise business
built on top of a consumer web platform,
is our most important value.
We have six values and
the first value is that
our members come first.
And when you have an enterprise culture,
an enterprise sales
culture, that would not
normally be the case, that
your members come first
or that some consumer
web platform comes first.
What would come first is the next sale
and hitting quota and results.
And results matter to us.
It's an important part of
our culture and demanding
excellence is one of our
most important values,
but it starts with members first
because we're unable to execute against
any of our enterprise business lines
if we don't have a flourishing
member-driven ecosystem.
So our members come first.
And the only way we've
been able to pull off
this idea of building
enterprise businesses
on top of a consumer
web platform is because
the person that runs those
enterprise sales forces,
thousands of people, recognizes that our
members come first and he is one of the
most steadfast leaders of the company
when it comes to manifesting
culture and values.
And trust me, he is not
just talking the talk.
He manifests it in quite
literally everything
that he does.
He models the behavior constantly,
to the point at sometimes
your're just like really?
But over time, you start
to recognize and appreciate
how strong a competitive
advantage you can build
as a result of that.
And his name's Mike Gamson
and Mike likes to say he's
not hiring sales people
or sales leaders, he's
hiring business people
and business leaders.
And he's not just saying
it, he's actually doing it
and that's one of the
reasons we've been able
to pull that off.
It's still very challenging as you know.
- [Reid] Yeah, so I just
thought I'd ask a question,
oh, go ahead Chris.
- [Voiceover] I was just
gonna say, I was just curious
if there were other things,
like people with books
or any other things
that have been as useful
or similar levels of usefulness
to break often to you?
- Useful in any capacity?
Or useful in a specific context?
- [Reid] Scaling companies, I'm gonna say
scaling companies because it's the class.
- Okay, you're saying scaling companies
and you're saying in the
context of being a CEO?
- [Reid] Being a CEO is fine, it's part of
scaling a company.
(laughing)
- Conscious business would have been
one of the books, second book would be
Art of Happiness, so that's Howard Cutler
and it's on the teachings
of the Dalai Lama
and that was the book where I learned
what compassion truly meant as opposed to
anecdotally, you know,
projecting my own experiences.
That book was a game changer.
That book has been on my nightstand since
1998
and I've only read it once cover to cover.
But I just like seeing
it because it brings me
right back to the messages that I learned
and took to heart.
And then a third book,
which does touch on scale
but in a counterintuitive way,
and Reid is very familiar
with the individual,
a book called Mountains Beyond Mountains
and it's the biography of Paul Farmer,
who created an organization
called Partners in Health.
And Paul grew up extremely poor,
very impoverished in the
South of the United States,
was brilliant and had gone to Harvard
studying medicine, becoming
a doctor, a professor.
And one summer when he was a kid
he worked on an orchard
and he worked alongside some Haitians,
and he was so struck
by their values
and what was important to them
and they way they lived their life.
He never forgot it.
And when he became a doctor,
recognizing that Central
Haiti is literally,
for those that don't know,
the poorest place in
the Western Hemisphere.
He started commuting from
Cambridge, Massachusetts
to Central Haiti and
helping one person at a time
with their health care,
and then he would fly back.
He was doing this on weekends.
It sounds insane.
And as if that wasn't insane enough,
word started to spread,
there were so many people
that started showing up,
that he recognized he
needed to build a facility
and generate more
resources and so he started
this organization called
Partners in Health.
And one of the partners
and founders, co-founders,
was a guy named Jim Kim,
who now is the president
of the World Bank,
which is the moral of the story,
it turns out that in helping
one person at a time,
I mean, he would help one person at a time
where he would hike eight hours each way
to help one person in Central Haiti,
even after he had
established the facility.
He would hear about
someone who was very sick
who needed him and he would hike on foot
eight hours in one direction to help them,
hike back, take care of
the rest of the people
that were at the facility and
then fly back to his day job.
And it turned out that
they learned so much about
helping the poorest among us,
in terms of their health care,
in terms of tuberculosis,
in terms of malaria,
in terms of HIV.
Jim eventually went down to Peru,
he did the same thing.
Word spread to certain African countries.
I think Russia picked up on this.
They just fundamentally changed the way
that the World Health Organization,
the way the United Nations,
the way countries thought about
taking care of their poorest.
Because historically, the
calculus had always been
it's not worth it from a return
on investment perspective.
And by virtue of helping
one person at a time,
they completely changed the game.
And so the lesson there,
and this is why it's a
bit counterintuitive,
is coming out of Yahoo I always thought
it was about massive scale
and working on platforms
that reached hundreds,
back then it was hundreds of millions,
now it's billions of people,
and what I learned from that book
is sometimes you can
scale on a global basis
by helping one person at a time.
And that was a complete eye opener for me.
- And by the way, just
the parallel for the class
to think about this is frequently the way
that you get to things at scale
is you start with things that don't scale,
and remember what Brian Chesky was saying
about what he did early in New York,
so there's this pattern
of starting with things,
sometimes the things that don't scale,
and then you getting the thing to scale.
And this was the community
health care worker model,
and so forth that Partners in Health did.
So, I'm gonna ask you one more question.
I have a stack, so in case there are
limited questions from the audience,
'cause we have about 20 minutes,
then I will go back to that.
After I ask my question,
I'm gonna ask Allen to ask the question
that he would've asked that I haven't
in this hour. (laughs)
Right, since he's also been
on this journey. (laughs)
- [Jeff] You've been here the whole time?
- [Voiceover] Almost.
(laughs)
- [Jeff] It's not like he's
easy to miss, by the way.
- So, I'm giving you a minute
to be on the spot, or a second to prep.
Being a Product CEO,
why is it so critical to success
in these companies in the Valley
to be a Product CEO,
and what is the way that you
do that effectively?
- So this is a leading question,
'cause I was hired to be the CEO,
in part because I am a product person,
and Reid and I both share
a very strong conviction
that the most valuable companies
in Silicon Valley, the most
valuable Internet companies,
are lead by product people.
You could have been a product manager.
You could've been an engineer.
You could have been
anything that would have
developed your product sensibility,
but at the end of the day these companies
create value through their products.
So I don't think it's a big stretch.
I think the further removed a CEO,
or the leader of an organization,
is from the product itself,
is from the core of how value is generated
within the company,
the more challenging it's gonna be
for that company to create value
sustainably over time.
And sometimes you probably have situations
with founders that
created that first product,
and then unfortunately
there's too many layers
that develop between them
and the day to day
development of that product.
And I think the most valuable companies,
I mean, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg,
Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, you know the names.
They're all product people.
First and foremost,
they're about products.
In Jeff's case it's about
product and customers.
I mean, that is his product.
He said, I just shared this the other day.
It was a quote from way back
when Amazon was first starting
and he said, "Amazon wasn't a bookstore,
"it's a customer store."
I thought that was pretty cool.
- [Voiceover] I was
gonna ask about hiring.
I mean, obviously LinkedIn had grown
tremendously over the past
six years, seven years
when you've been CEO.
And you've always said at company meetings
that talent was our number one priority,
number one principle, to
use the word we often do,
so how do you think
about the changing needs
for hiring as a company passes
the thousand person mark
and now is at the ten
thousand person mark?
How is the role of hiring different now
than it was when you started?
- In some regards it's
not different at all,
and I'll come back to that in a second,
and in other regards
it's vastly different.
So the machinery that
goes into hiring at scale
once you achieve, you know, critical mass,
when you're at 15 people
and you're hiring single digit people
to add to the team,
that's something the team can do.
When you're at 150 people
trying to scale to 300
and you need double the
size of the company,
at some point you're gonna need
to have dedicated recruiters.
When you're at 300 and
you're growing to 3,000,
you're gonna need sourcers,
and then you're gonna need
people to support them,
and you're gonna need
recruiters and schedulers,
and the apparatus, the machinery,
behind recruiting at scale
is quite substantial,
so in that regard that changes.
That's very logical.
What shouldn't change,
but unfortunately does,
is once you recognize who you are
as an organization,
your culture, your values,
the more you can hire against
your culture and values
and not compromise,
I think the more likely
you are to be successful.
And where a lot of hyper growth
companies go off the rails
is they need to grow from 150 to 300
to keep pace with the competition,
to develop that next
breakthrough innovation,
to hire sales people to fulfill demand,
to hire people in G&amp;A functions,
to be able to support the
rest of the organization,
and without putting butts in the seats,
there may be a fear that it's gonna
limit the growth of the organization,
and so what happens inevitably,
is where as you've set the bar
very clearly and explicitly
in terms of where you wanna
hire, who you wanna hire,
the quality of people, the cultural fit,
you start to compromise.
So for example, you'll see someone,
they'll come in and on paper,
LinkedIn profile for example,
they have great skills,
but for whatever reason
during the interview process
you got the sense they're
not gonna be a cultural fit.
Where an organization's headed for trouble
is when you sit around
with your hiring team,
your hiring committee,
whatever decision making
process you have for recruiting,
and someone says, look at
the skills of this person.
We interviewed them,
they're not a cultural fit,
but we'll make it work.
We'll coach them.
There'll be a process of osmosis here.
They'll just figure out how we do things.
And talk to folks who have
hired in that situation
and they'll tell you that
inevitably it did not work out.
It actually created a bunch of problems.
And where an organization's in a position
where it can scale effectively
is the next time that conversation is had,
it's, look at the skills of this person.
They're not a cultural fit,
let's move on to the next candidate.
And when your team is
having that conversation
without you needing to be in the room,
that's when you're on to something,
and that's when you can truly scale,
at least scale the hiring process.
- [Reid] Back first, you.
- [Voiceover] So when it
comes to managing people,
like I believe LinkedIn has the smartest
people in the world,
I'm just curious about how do you manage
the smartest people?
How do you make them (too low to hear).
- How do you make them think what?
- [Voiceover] How do you make them
do things that you feel the
company should be doing?
- [Reid] How do you
manage very smart people?
I think that's the simple--
- Well the reason I
was asking the phrasing
is because I think it's helpful,
so you said, "How do I
make them do the things
"that the company needs them to do?"
(laughs)
- [Voiceover] Like you have a vision
or you have an idea of where
the company should be going.
- Yeah, yeah,
so did you hear laughter
behind your left shoulder?
- [Voiceover] I did, yes.
- So it was John, I
don't even need to look.
(laughs)
And my guess is it was John,
and John's laughing because of
when you said, "How do
you make them do things?"
You don't make very
smart people do anything.
What you do is, hopefully,
you inspire them to want to take action.
And it's the difference
between leaders and managers.
Managers tell people what to do,
oftentimes without very effective results,
leaders inspire them to do it.
And I've been very fortunate
from a pretty young age
to have the ability to recognize
really talented people.
People way more talented than I am,
way smarter than I am,
and once you can recognize those folks,
if you can get an understanding
of what they want to accomplish,
and you can find alignment between
what you're trying to accomplish
and what they're trying to accomplish,
and you can authentically get across
why it's such a strong fit,
why their skill set, their
unique set of skills,
their intelligence, their resourcefulness,
their passion, their compassion,
how it can be brought to bear,
to create this huge amount
of value on a global basis,
hopefully they're gonna want to do that,
and hopefully they'll buy into that.
And that's very different
than telling them what to do.
And especially with the kinds of people
you were describing, like
the smartest people you know,
they're not gonna respond very well
to being told what to do.
- [Reid] You, yes.
- [Voiceover] You mention
Reid's first principle
of preserving marginality,
what are some of you first principles
that you always come back to
when you're facing some sort of
complex decisions?
- So, managing compassionately
is my first principle of management,
but you asked a very specific question,
when I'm facing a complex decision.
- [Voiceover] Something
you just come back to.
- To not make a decision before I'm ready,
which took a long time to realize.
Sometimes you won't
always have that luxury.
Sometimes you're gonna have to
make a decision before you're ready to,
but if you're not forced
to make a decision
before you're ready to make a decision,
give it time.
Give it time.
And I think too often, people rush it.
They don't have the right
set of information yet.
I'm not talking about analysis paralysis.
I'm not talking about having the perfect
amount of information.
There's no such thing as perfection,
but oftentimes effective decision makers,
they have pretty strong conviction.
They're relying on pattern
matching and experiences.
They're relying upon
people around the table,
that diverse set of decision
makers and influencers,
and they know, they know,
and they'll make the right
decision more often than not,
not gonna make the right
decision every time.
But if they're not feeling it,
it's okay to hit the pause button,
and say I'm not ready
to make this decision.
And I'm not sure everyone
fully appreciates
the fact that they have that ability.
They have that opportunity.
Also, once you make a decision,
if you made the wrong decision,
don't be afraid to admit it,
learn from it,
and then move in a different direction.
And that's another common mistake,
which is you feel like as
the person responsible,
or the leader, or the manager,
that you can't show any vulnerability.
You have to be perfect.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The last thing in the world I want
is to be surprised.
If teams understand that
things aren't performing
the way they had expected,
I want to know that as soon as possible,
so we can do something about it,
and I want to model that
behavior for my team.
- By the way, the one,
I think that's perfectly
coherent and a good answer,
but the one thing I actually learned
from PayPal days was,
when you're in fast moving, intense,
competitive situations,
which startups are,
the time frame that you
have to make a decision
is the time frame where you will not
remove your foot from completely
depressing the accelerator.
So part of the decisioning I do is,
how much time do I have,
such that I maintain
entire forward motion?
And sometimes it's, I
make a decision right now.
And one of the things I
picked up from PayPal was,
I will frequently make
a decision right now
and then say, do I have
time to rethink it?
Right? And then, Oh I have until tomorrow.
It's like, oh, okay, great.
I'm gonna rethink it until tomorrow,
which then plays in to what you said,
but it's an interesting play.
- Another corollary
is that at some point you
do need to make a decision.
The worst possible thing you can do
is just allow it to sit there,
and it just builds over time.
And we're talking about
scaling organizations,
those things, they compound and compound.
So after leaving Yahoo, I became an EIR.
I didn't know if I was burnt out on Yahoo.
It was tough going towards the end.
It was an extraordinary experience,
and I wouldn't trade it
for anything, invaluable,
but towards the end it
was pretty challenging
on a number of different fronts.
And I didn't know if I was burnt out
on that specific situation,
or I was burnt out on operations,
so I wanted to take some
time off, I was an EIR.
And then the first day, literally,
this sounds like I'm just making this up,
but it's a true story.
The first day I set foot at LinkedIn,
I couldn't wipe the smile from my face,
and one of the reasons was
because we could make decisions
in minutes or hours that in previous roles
I found companies
requiring weeks or months,
if they ever made the decision at all.
And to this day, when we're
able to make a decision,
a good decision, we're able
to make it in a timely way,
I start smiling to myself.
I'm thinking about, that's how you do it.
Speed and quality of decisions,
I can't emphasize it enough.
- [Reid] Second guy on
the aisle here. Yeah.
(speaking too soft to hear)
- Sorry?
- [Reid] Elaborate on it.
- Oh, elaborate on it? Oh, economy graph.
So I mentioned earlier that
we're doing some stuff at LinkedIn
that I've never done before,
which is trying to operationalize
our vision, the dream,
and historically for me
the vision is just that,
it's true north, it's a dream,
it's not something you actually do.
And a few years ago we recognized that we
were growing our membership faster
than we had anticipated,
so when we originally codified the mission
to connect the world's professionals,
we had 32 million members
when I first joined
December 2008.
We recently surpassed 400 million people
who signed up for LinkedIn.
And a couple of years ago it became clear
we were gonna be on a trajectory
to exceed the midway
mark to that 780 million.
And at that time, granted,
once we've connected the
world's professionals,
making them more
productive and successful,
there's plenty of work
to be done on that front.
It's not just about connecting
and signing people up.
But we did start asking
ourselves what would come next,
and where we ended up was
bringing our vision to life,
this idea of creating economic opportunity
for every member of the global workforce,
all three billion people,
not just knowledge
workers and professionals,
or students, everyone,
everyone in the global workforce.
And so the way in which we decided
to go about that,
was by essentially digitally mapping
the global economy across six dimensions.
The six dimensions that
we believed LinkedIn
was in a very unique
position to execute against.
So the economic graph would mean
having a profile on LinkedIn
for every member of the global workforce,
all three billion plus people.
It would mean having a presence
for every company in the world.
When you include small,
medium size businesses,
there's about 60 to 70 million
companies in the world.
It would mean having a
digital representation
for every available job opportunity
offered by those companies.
There's roughly, we
estimate on the order of
20 million jobs that would
be digitally accessible
that are open right now on a global basis.
A digital representation
for every skill required
to obtain the jobs offered
by those companies,
tens upon tens of thousands of skills
that you could access
through standardized data.
A digital presence for every university,
higher educational organization,
or vocational training facility
that would enable individuals to
acquire the skills to get the jobs
offered by those companies.
And a publishing platform
that would enable every individual,
every company, and every university
to share their professionally
relevant knowledge
to the extent they're
interested in doing so.
And then we would wanna take a step back
and allow all forms of capital,
intellectual capital, working capital,
of course human capital,
to flow to where it
could best be leveraged.
And in doing so, we're hoping we can lift
and transform the global economy.
So that's the economic graph.
So when we originally
started talking about that
it was a vision.
And to some extent it
sounded like science fiction.
And what happened was over time
it actually started to manifest itself.
So we started investing
the infrastructure,
the people, the teams, we
made some acquisitions.
And what changed for us
was asking what it would take
to operate at economic graph scale.
And I'll give you a perfect example,
when I first joined the company
we has somewhere in the order of
six to eight thousand jobs
that were posted on LinkedIn.
And at some point along the way,
we identified an addressable opportunity
for professional jobs, high
value, white collar jobs,
roughly 350,000,
and that grew to about half a million,
that was the addressable.
We hit about 300 plus thousand
and on our way to that number,
I think we were around 250,000,
I had a meeting with the
team responsible for that,
and as I had mentioned on a
number of different occasions,
I said, don't forget, you
gotta start thinking about
how we can get all the jobs,
20 million,
and I turned to leave the room
and it occurred to me,
and I had said it on multiple occasions
with this specific team
and this specific context,
they just thought it was a platitude.
They thought I was just kind
of throwing it out there,
and so I turned around and walked back in.
I said, "You do realize
I'm serious about this?"
You could feel it all,
like for whatever reason
in that moment it finally
sank into the team
that I meant it.
And so they went out and developed
a strategy and a roadmap to do it.
And we ended up acquiring
a company called Bright,
brilliant team.
And we are now up to five million jobs
that are on LinkedIn today available.
And we have roughly two and
a half times that amount
that have been indexed.
And we're just still
thinking about the best way
to offer those up in an index
and make sure they're relevant
and so forth and so on,
scrubbing the data,
deduping, all that stuff.
And we're on our way to ultimately
the goal is to have 20 million
jobs accessible on LinkedIn.
You could do the exact same exercise
with the number of members on LinkedIn,
the number of companies on LinkedIn,
in terms of the skill sets,
it wasn't enough for us to just identify
which skills people needed,
we ultimately believe that we
should offer up coursework,
so that people could learn the skills
and we acquired a company called Lynda,
which in my opinion was the last piece,
fundamental piece of the building blocks
that we needed for this puzzle.
And the publishing platform started
with 500 professional luminaries,
that we called influencers,
and today well north, it's probably north
of 250 million people have the ability
to publish in long form on LinkedIn.
And months and months ago
we surpassed a million people
that had actually taken the time
to publish on LinkedIn in long form.
So it's not just talking about it,
it's actually coming to life,
and really the only thing preventing us
for achieving that scale
at this point is time.
So that's the economic graph.
- [Reid] In time. So, here.
- [Voiceover] It's a
question about growing
or blitzscaling businesses and managing
the acquisition of a new dot com.
I believe it's much more
than selling online courses,
so what's your vision for, you know,
there is a convergence of industries
(speaking too low to hear)
How do you see this going beyond,
and even more so, with the complexity
of a business, or to be business,
because the corporate market's huge.
- Huge, yeah.
- [Voiceover] But also the execution
of that market is very different,
from the execution of the consumer market,
which brings a lot of, it's much more
service oriented.
Corporations demand much more services
than the consumer businesses.
How do you actually scale that
and what's the vision?
- [Reid] And we only have
time for a short answer,
'cause I wanna do one more question,
since a couple people haven't--
- Short answer is a platform approach
where Lynda evolves as a true platform,
so for any enterprise, any
company for that matter
that's developed its own repository
of learning development materials,
we want to be able to
enhance those materials
by virtue of offering them through Lynda,
and that could be solely and exclusively
to the employees of that specific company,
it could be to members and constituents
within that company's
ecosystem, like developers,
it could be to college students,
that helps build the talent
band of that organization
and better prepares them to actually work
at that company over time,
so those would be some examples.
And that platform approach wouldn't
be exclusive to enterprises.
There are content generators,
there are events, conferences,
television networks,
that I think are very interested
in developing learning materials
that could also take advantage of that.
Is this the last one or you?
Okay, got it.
- [Voiceover] Can you talk a little about
how you identify talent
and how you identify
talent at varying degrees,
like above average, top 10%,
top 5%, top 1%?
- So I don't have a formula
for the percentiles per se,
that would be an interesting model,
sounds like something
Reid would do, by the way.
He probably has a construct
in there somewhere
in that brain of his.
What I'm looking for depends on the role,
so broadly across any role,
which may be the most appropriate
given the limited amount of time.
In this day and age,
I'm looking for people
that are to your point earlier,
extremely intelligent,
and not just a kind of
broad based aptitude,
or high IQ,
people who can learn very quickly,
people whose learning
curves are almost vertical,
super steep learning curves,
who love learning,
who love continuous improvement,
who love operating within
dynamic environments,
who can gain fluency quickly
in terms of new things,
who enjoy synthesizing vast
amounts of information,
connecting dots, reaching conclusions,
and sharing those conclusions
and insights with other people.
So that kind of intelligence I think
is essential.
Looking for people who are both
passionate about the work that we do
and the work that they do,
and hopefully there's alignment there,
who, if they wouldn't describe
what we're doing as their dream jobs,
it certainly brings them one step closer
to their dream.
That kind of passion becomes
a huge force multiplier and amplifies
the ability for people to create
and contribute value.
Looking for people who are compassionate
to the point we were describing earlier.
Looking for people who recognize
that despite the fact that all of us
are egocentric by nature,
not egomaniacal, egocentric,
we see the world through our own lens,
people who recognize the importance
and the value of taking the time
to see the world through
somebody else's perspective
and who has some kind of experience,
or some kind of recognition of the value
and the importance of that,
and looking for people that
I look forward to working with.
You know, I got to a point in my career
where it's just not worth it
to work with assholes,
and I don't care how much
value they contribute,
and, you know, Reid
didn't ask me a question
that I've been asked in a number
of different settings
like this fireside chats
is what's the most valuable lesson
I've learned as the CEO?
And arguably the most valuable lesson
I've learned, which
unfortunately I've learned
on more than one occasion,
is for the baseball fans in
this section of the audience,
it's leaving the pitcher
in the game for too long.
So for those of you who are
less familiar with baseball,
the metaphor is that pitcher on the mound,
potentially even a star pitcher
who's pitching a beautiful game
through the first five or six innings,
and you can see that the fastball
is losing a little bit of velocity
and people are getting around on it
and maybe even getting
on base a little bit
and your team's still up,
manager comes out and asks the pitcher
how the pitcher's doing.
And a star pitcher, what do you think
a star pitcher's gonna say?
I'm doing great, skip, go sit down.
That's not the manager's job,
is to just ask how the pitcher's doing
and then take it verbatim and sit down.
The manager's job is to assess
whether or not the pitcher
is gonna be able to win the game
and position the team to win the game.
The most valuable lesson I've learned
is once you recognize that someone
may not be the right fit for
the role that they're in,
as soon as you ask yourself whether or not
they're the right fit, you
already know the answer.
The question is what
you're gonna do about it.
And what I've learned over time
is that you have a very open, honest
constructive conversation,
that's another value of ours,
transparently communicate where your
expectations are,
the fact that they're not
meeting those expectations
and that you're gonna do whatever you can
to help them get above that bar.
You're gonna provide them all the coaching
that they need,
but you're gonna do it over
a specific period of time
and you're gonna be very open with them
as to whether or not
you're making progress,
you're not making progress,
and if they're not,
in the most compassionate
and constructive way
you possibly can, you
transition them either
to another role within the organization
or to their next play
outside of the organization.
And that is a really key part
to scaling an organization,
so it's not just about
identifying the right talent
to bring into the company,
it's also about assessing the talent
that you currently have
and sometimes making those hard decisions.
- And if you, I went over the back story
for when I did the share
of the Ronan quote,
if there is a question,
there is no question,
it was Jeff and I having this conversation
actually over dinner.
And then the last thing I will say is when
Jeff was describing how
he identifies talent,
that was the reason,
that was about 90% of the description
on why I actually recruited
you to be the CEO of LinkedIn.
- [Voiceover] How many hours
did you spend with Jeff
before you recruited him?
- [Reid] How many hours do you remember?
- So it was north of 15 to 20.
It may have gone to--
- [Reid] 30 plus.
- 30 overtime.
- [Reid] It was 30 plus.
- [Voiceover] You reviewed
him for 30 hours yourself?
- But it wasn't, John, the key is that
for Reid it may have been an interview,
for me it was a conversation and--
- [Reid] All the best
interviews are conversations.
- Conversations,
and, you know, when I
first joined LinkedIn,
you can tell a lot about
what's on people's minds
by virtue of the questions they ask you,
and so I kind of keep tabs on
the most frequently asked question I get,
and shortly after joining the company,
by far and away the most
frequently asked question
I got was, "So what's it
like working with Reid?"
(laughs)
And it was code for,
what kind of drama are you experiencing
by virtue of being a hired CEO
and still having the
founder of the company?
And what people didn't realize was
I wasn't at LinkedIn in
spite of Reid being there,
I was at LinkedIn in large part
because Reid was there.
So I wanted the opportunity
to work together over time,
and the time that we spent together
before I joined formally
gave us an opportunity to
build that relationship,
and to take a lot of
what would normally be
very natural questions in
variability and uncertainty,
to some extent we were
able to really remove that
and had already developed
a relationship based on trust
before my first day on the job,
so I think that, you know,
that was a very positive
thing in retrospect.
- And the detail of
that is in the essay of
when you're hiring a CEO,
you're actually hiring a co-founder,
which is on LinkedIn if you have interest.
And with that, let's
thank Jeff for joining us.
