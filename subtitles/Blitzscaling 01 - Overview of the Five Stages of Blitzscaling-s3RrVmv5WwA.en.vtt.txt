WEBVTTKind: captionsLanguage: en- [Voiceover] We're glad you're on it.
- (laughs) Yes, very much.
Thank you for coming.
Let's see, so I'm gonnaintroduce my three co-instructorsand then John will, Iguess, take it from there,including probably sayingsomething entertaining about me,although not to put the burden too high.
So Allen, standing here, ismy co-founder at LinkedIn.
He and I were actually atStanford the same years.
We did not know each other then.
We got introduced to each otherthrough the valley networkon my very first startup, Socialnet,our very first start up, Socialnet.
And used to do thingslike craft gaieties and everything else,which the Stanford students will remember.
Chris Yeh, who is here inthe front, is my coauthoron the book The Alliance.
We are also working on a bookon this subject of blitzscaling as well,which is part of whatconditions this class.
John Lilly, who is here, isthe only one of the four of uswith being a, having been a professorfor an entire quarter before.
(laughs) Well, not a professor, yes.
Lecturer, lecturer, yes.
I remember the teacher,and has done that at thed.school and some other placesand was the CEO who scaled Mozillaand is now partner with me at Greylockand I will let John--- [Chris] So most of all, if I know Reid- Reid is also--- [Reid] Remember the video.
- Oh yeah, shit.
I'm pretty bad with mics,so we'll just have to sort this out.
So, yeah, thanks for coming.
Reid and I collaborated a long, long time.
We also didn't knoweach other at Stanford.
We got to know each otherabout ten years later,introduced through a friendof ours who was at Stanford.
The connection you makehere are pretty criticaland very, very, very long-lasting.
And the work you do with groups here,the people you meet, willimpact your career greatlyand we'll talk about thata lot during the class.
So anyways, so Reid, founder of LinkedIn,my partner at Greylock,has been on the boardsof any number of companies,was one of the early guys at PayPal,Socialnet, Apple, abunch of of other places,well, not early at Apple buthe's not that old,(class laughs)but close, yeah.
Anyway, so, well, we should just talk.
So let's talk about it.
- Wait, we've got legal disclaimers.
- Legal disclaimers, sweet.
- All right team, well, asthe modern world of educationrequires me to say a couple of thingsbefore you participate in this class.
First, by participating inthis class you are granting uspermission to use and distributethe content you create for this class,though you are still theowner and rights holder.
So, anyone who's planningto sign a contractbased on the class, you stillown your content, not ours.
These class sessions aregoing to be recorded,as you can tell by the video cameras.
And these are going tobe publicly distributed.
That means that whilethe videos are probablynot going to show any students,if, in fact, you do not feel comfortablewith the slight possibilitythat you'll appear on camera,you should move to one ofthe far corners of the roomassuming it was possible to move.
(class laughs)But in the future,please do sit in thefour corners of the room.
We do not want anybody who does not wishto appear on camera to appear on camera.
Similarly, if we'regiving you an opportunityto ask questions and youdon't feel comfortableasking your questionwith the cameras rolling,the instructors and any guest speakerswill stay briefly afterclass to answer questionsthat you did not feel comfortable askingwith the cameras rolling.
And with that we are now legally clear.
(class laughs)- All right, so, cool.
So, just a couple things.
Just quick background.
The class is sort of built onthree different traditions.
So when I was here as a CSstudent a little while ago,there was a class taught calledBusiness for Computer Scientistsand a guy named Dave Liddle,who was one of theearly guys at Xerox PARCand a number of other places,got up and talked for a quarter abouthow to do a balance sheet, how to do PNL,how to do all that stuff andhow to run a basic business.
We're not gonna do any of that,but it was a huge thing formy career and think abouta bunch of computer scientistsbuilding businesses.
The second thing that'sworth mentioning is thatentrepreneurship at Stanfordis unbelievably well supportedby guys like Tom Byers and Tina Seeligand people who have builtentrepreneurship classesand scaling classes, like Bob Sutton.
So, we'll talk about ourparticular brand of scaling,the one that we see andtouch and build every day,but there's so much atStanford that I thinkeverybody should be paying attention toand be grateful that you have.
And then the third thing,the third sort of tradition is built onis this is class called CS183c.
Two years ago,Peter Thiel taught a classcalled CS183 about startups,memorializing a book called Zero to One.
Last year, Sam Altman, from Y Combinator,taught a class about startup school.
That was sort of the spiritual successor,which is, how do you actuallyget from zero to one?And then this is, in a lotof ways, the sequel to that,which is, starting up iscool, but what's really coolis how do you build a big,durable business at scaleand that's what SiliconValley's really special for.
So, those are the three traditions.
And so, you know, stand onthe shoulders of giants.
You guys are very lucky at avery lucky time at Stanford.
So with that, what you shouldn't expectfrom this class is a few things.
So you shouldn't expectus to teach you howto read a balance sheet or PLor do financial modelingor any of that stuff.
You shouldn't expect any of us to agreewith each other very often.
We're gonna talk abouta lot of thing--(Reid mumbles something)(John and class laugh)Exactly.
Right, you shouldn't expectus to be serious all the time.
And you shouldn't expect a playbook.
This is not how to pitch us to a VC,this is not how to get a company funded.
What you should expect ishow to think about how to grow companiesreally big and really makethe fundamental companies.
You should expect us to get into itwith the guest speakers who are coming,and we have a lot of amazingguest speakers who are coming.
And you should expectus to answer questionsand engage with you and we should expectyou each to learn from eachother as we post contentto the LinkedIn group andto medium questions as well.
- [Reid] Which we will get to at the end.
Which we will explainin just a little bit.
And then the last thing Ishould say, and Sam Altmanhad a very good commentat the very beginning,he was a little bitself conscious last yearabout teaching a class,because he thinks that,his point of view was, youshould only start a companyif you're really dying to start a company.
And so, encouraging people todo it is a little bit scarybecause the job of starting a companyis such an intense, hard job.
Really the only peoplewho should start a companyare people who can't not start companies.
So, we're gonna say a lot of thingsthat might me be relevant to your companyor your startups or yourambitions and they might not.
Your mileage may vary, sojust, fair warning, yeah?And you can ask questions today.
You can ask questions today.
I don't like mics.
(Chris laughs)You can ask questionstoday when we lecture.
When our guests come in,we're gonna do more moderated,but today and when we lectureyou can be pretty free-flying,just raise your handif you have questions.
There will be a way to submit questionsthat we will then edit before the classwhen we're having guest lecturersso we have it highly editedand useful to the group.
The other things in termof the mileage may varyis our target here is not a playbook,our target is essentiallyshining a light aheadbecause the general mytharound entrepreneurshipis that you just havean idea and it works,and actually, in fact,there's a tremendous amountof innovation, hardwork, skilled activity,and everything else that goes into this.
And so, part of the ideais it's not a simple recipe.
It's not insert capital,insert a little bitof technology, stir, it happens.
So, there's heuristics, not rules.
There's kind of ways to think about this.
And so that's the kindof thing we're doingand it's more or less of big concepts.
It's kind of what are the conceptsas you're beginning to think about this.
Now one of the things that we,when we started this work,we're still actually lookingfor a better term than this, blitzscaling.
Might as well go to the next slide,if I recall the next slide.
Yup. (laughs)Which is, is that, in fact,one of the things we think we need hereis kind of a specialized term for this.
And there's things thatare good about this term,which is the speed of scale,the speed of deploymenton a global basis, the speedof building an organization,something that iscrafted as a term of art.
There are parallelsbetween business strategyand military strategies, that's okay.
It's less okay because it'snot universally military.
And so, we're still looking for,like this is part ofwhat we're working outbecause, by the way, justlike any entrepreneurial thingwe're working on the book and doing thisas we're teaching thisclass and so we are doingsuch things as thinking about this termand saying, "Does thisterm actually really work?"So, this is the classicmythos of Silicon Valley,which is it's a land of startups.
It's a land of,essentially, you don't havekind of a culture offailure, a fear of failure.
That you're not penalized whenyou try something and fail.
You can try it again.
That you can assemble a groupof founders here very easily.
There's venture capital,universities such as Stanford,and there's a way to make that happen.
And this is the classic story.
Frequently what I find fromtalking to young entrepreneurs,they just think they gettheir app right and it works.
You get some capital, people love the app,and then you're off to the races.
This is the classic story about whatmakes Silicon Valley strongand that's partially true.
If you don't have that previous story,you're not gonna succeed.
So, figuring out howto do that effectivelyis actually one of the thingsthat's really importantabout the beginning of entrepreneurshipand that's what you see inmany entrepreneurship classes.
How do you select a founder?How do you know if theidea's right or not?How do you get your initial financing?How do you figure out whatthe competition's doing?Whether it's relevant, whether Googleor Microsoft is doing this,these sorts of things.
Those are all actually importantto succeed in this journey.
However, there's a problem with the story.
The problem with the story is thatwhen you begin to look at the whole worldin terms of the ability toassemble 10 or 20 people,do a initial idea, have the idea about howto distribute it in the appstore, how to distribute it in ayou know, kind of on SEO orvirality, in terms of the web,how to make all of these things happen.
I have visited at least20 places personallywhere you can assemble 10 to 20 people,where they have enough knowledge,venture capital has gone global.
This is all something where you cando a startup in many areas of the worldand we say, "Well, there'sstill a culture here,"there's still a network."That's all obviously true.
There's still a differentialedge to Silicon Valley,but now the world knows, thatactually entrepreneurshipis a very good thing, thatactually having peopletake a bold venture effortto make something happenis part of how you createthe jobs of the future,that technology is transforming industriesand this is something they want.
And so the question comes down to,well, why is it thatSilicon Valley still createsa massive number of veryinteresting companies?Why is it that thisplace is still so unique?And startups are part of it, but actuallythe ability to scale isa key portion of this.
And the notion of scalingrevenue, scaling customersand actually scaling organizationsand how do we do thatand how do we run that playbookin a consistent fashion,not to say that it always works'cause this is all venture, remember,but in a way that showsmassively differential results.
What is the underpinnings?The risks, the opportunities,the decisions that gointo that, that is essentiallywhat the class is about.
Are we?- [John] Yeah.
- [Reid] So, this is you, isn't it?- Sure, well, yeah.
So, here.
So, this is what we talkabout when we mean big.
So we just did a quickscan of the companiesthat we know about in technologythat are 10 billion or bigger.
There's not a ton, 10 billionis a pretty large number.
This is the publiccompanies that are bigger.
And it's worth noting thatthese are all Silicon Valley,except for Tencent and Alibaba.
Everything else is Silicon Valley.
And if you'll note, they're speeding up.
So there were four in 1998, 1999.
You know, Google, Tencent,Alibaba, and Salesforce,but now they're starting to speed up.
You can start to see thatmore and more value creation.
And so this is not the only way to judgehow large a company is,how big a company is,but it is worth noting all Silicon Valleyand a couple of Beijingand Chinese companies.
And then lately, obviously,lots and lots and lots of unicorns.
This is the best unicornpicture I could find of this.
I was looking for a CreativeCommons unicorn herd picture.
Anyhow, this is the best I could find.
It's kind of growing on me though.
(students laugh)So, anyhow.
- [Reid] You realize whatyour Christmas present is now,right?- So good, right?Pink unicorns and, youknow, our friend Aileen Leepopularized the term unicorn.
It's worth mentioning at this pointnow there's unicorns,unicorpses, and dragons,and all this other stuff.
(class laughs)And the billion dollar thingis kind of a goofball metric.
She was trying to say, look,there are more big companiesgetting started now than ever before.
There's something unusual happeningand that's her main point.
And so we try to quantify it.
We were looking through the CrunchBase.
Oh and I guess I should say,these are all paper unicorns.
These are all paper valuations.
Companies are worth, at some level,what people would pay for themand until a market gets made,they're all, sort of at somelevel, pretend valuations.
Having said that, let's just lookby region what's happening.
So, of the top 10 youcan see Uber and Airbnb,Palantir, Pinterest,Dropbox, Silicon Valley,so about half the companies.
The two in China, Xiaomi and Didi Kuaidi,are in Beijing.
Snapchat and SpaceX are in LA,but I would argue haveprofoundly Silicon Valley rootsbetween Elon and Evan and Bobby.
And then Flipkart's in Bangalore.
So if you play out and say,"Look, what about the top 60?"It looks the same.
So you add 23 moreSilicon Valley companies,a few more Chinese companies,you pick up some in New York and Europeand then elsewhere is, youknow, a couple in Floridaand, well, not manyother places, honestly.
But here's the kicker:You look at what the population isthat produces each of these things,7 million people, fewer thanthe population of New Yorkis trading half of the unicornsto date by CrunchBase metrics.
There's something interestinghappening that's justqualitatively differentthan anywhere else.
And so the question is what?And like Reid said, it's not starting up,it's how do you get really big?- What we're going to be illustrating hereand part of the way thatwe're gonna be doing thisand this is the reason why we're havinga number of guestlectures, is there isn't,as I mentioned, one playbook.
What there is is a kind of aset of knowledge and practice,a set of things in termsof how to make this work.
And, part of what we'regonna do is bring in someof the people who actually run this race,who do this, and talk with them about it.
All of us have, which ispart of why we're here,but we're also gonna bringin folks from other companiesand say, how did you make this work?What key messages?And why does, as a wayto try to illustrate,what is it that we knowhere in Silicon Valley,what is it we have here in Silicon Valley,and what is the way we play this gamethat actually can be helpfulto entrepreneurs here,to executives here, but also,hopefully, everywhere in the world.
The degree to which it's relevant willdepend a lot on capital in thearea, technology in the area,availability of talent anda bunch of other things,but the goal is to actually shine a lightthat's actually useful to everybody.
Let's go past this one.
All right, so one of the things that,let's just keep going, 'cause we've talkedabout scaling enough. (laughs)Okay, so one of the key thingsthat you'll find ustalking a lot about hereis, essentially, theimportance of networks.
And obviously when I say that people tendto think that I'm only meaning LinkedIn.
LinkedIn is obviouslyborn out of that idea,but it's actually similarly a projectionfrom a fundamental idea.
And, so networks also are not,like some people say, oh, you mean Ciscoor IP routers, or these sorts of things.
I mean, those are a veryimportant part of this networkand part of being partof the networked age,but those also are not the networksthat I'm fundamentally talking about.
The networks are questions of people.
One of the things that we talkabout at LinkedIn is the knowledge graph,so it's companies, people, jobs, skills,you know, universities, howthese all relate to each other.
Those are the kinds of networksthat we're talking about.
And one of the thingsthat when you look atwhy it is Silicon Valleywork so well is the networksof a bunch of differenttypes all interwovenwork very well here.
And that's the thing that createsnetworks being amplifiers,where the network canactually amplify what you do.
There's a number of people I meetwho think that they're in Silicon Valleyand they just happen to be geniusesand that's why they can create stuff here.
Actually, in fact, thenetwork is very helpful.
You might be a genius, thatmay actually in fact be true,but part of the key move, frequently,is locating the companyhere and building it herebecause you're deploying the networks.
Now I don't think those networks,I think it's possibleto build them anywhere.
I think there's some kind oforganic luck that comes into itbut I think there's aset of cultural things,a set of communication things,a set of ideational thingsto get into creating networks.
And, you know, so here'ssome of the networks.
I mean, some of it's talent,some of it's capital,some of it's know-how,some of it's people.
And what's key, and this is the reason whywhen you begin to saywhy is it that we arein an accelerating age where more globallyimpactful and transformational companiesare happening within Silicon Valley,the answer is, is thatwe're in this networked age.
You're much abler toget to lots of people,all around the world, very fast,now they can too.
Theoretically in a networked age,you should see a dispersion of essentiallyunicorns, dragons, unicorpses, etc.
You're about to say something?- [John] Yeah- [John] I would justsay that this is builton so many years and youhear Fred Wilson or somebodytalk about New York andthe emerging networkand he's like, "Look, you know, New York"is emerging as a technology network,"but, you know, Silicon Valley's got"probably 60 years on us."Back to the guys with names all aroundon the buildings and all around campus,whether it's Hewlett and Packard,who were Terman's students,to the Yahoo guys to Google,it's just building layerafter layer after layerand what's happened is you'vejust gotten a huge diversityof roles and talent, from fundersto strategic people to product people,who all understand networks and are allinvesting in networkover and over and over.
So, I think what Reid says is right.
You can do this anywhere, it's just,it takes a long, long time.
We'll show you lots of graphs of companiesand they almost all lookflat, flat, flat, flat,flat, flat, flat, andthen something happensand the network starts toget internal consistencyand liquidity and take off.
That happens again and again and againand Silicon Valley was mostlyflat for a really long timeand then it got Hewlett Packard and Inteland Fairchild and thenit started really rampingin the 80s and 90s and nowit's in pretty good shape.
- Late 90s specifically, but yes.
- So, that's the subjectof what we are trying to doand that's what we arecalling blitzscaling.
Now, why don't we go to the next slide?So these are the thingsthat you will hear a lot of.
And part of this is, we'vedeliberately kept this,we're not trying to do amasterful orchestrationwhere you only heareach sentence only once.
Part of having guest lecturesin and so forth is there arethings that you will hearon a repetitive basisThat's useful information.
You will hear peopledisagreeing on some things,that's useful informationbecause there isn't justsimply one strategy for making this work.
As a matter of fact, we don't just embodyone strategy here in Silicon Valley,but there are some commonthemes that you will hear.
These are some of the common themes.
So, one, networks, we'vealready gone through thatin some depth and you'll hear a lot moreabout it in this quarter,also, in fact, part of the thingabout compounding to scale.
So how is it that you get a revenue modelthat feeds back capitalinto scaling an organizationboth locally and globallyand making that workor scaling the way thatyou can pitch a financingso you have a lot more capital to fundthe growth of the organization.
And one other thing I thinkis probably worth to sayis that there's thisinterrelationship betweenorganization scale, revenuescale, and customer scale.
Ideally, if you actually talk to mostof the accomplished SiliconValley entrepreneurs,they try to keep theirorganizational scaleas trim as possible for customer scaleand revenue scale becauseit maintains adaptability,it maintains ability to grow.
However, as you really beginto get to revenue scaleas you really begin toget to customer scalewhere you are essentially havingreasonable customer service,although those are someof the hacks we will get into,you actually begin toneed organizational scale.
- We'll explain it, we're already startingto use jargon.
- [Reid] Yeah, sorry.
- [John] So, one of the things is howyou will not believe the number of timeswe're gonna say the worddistribution in this class,it's gonna be a lot, I promise you.
And it's because we say distribution a lotin our daily work, inevery company we talk to,every pitch we see, we talkdistribution, distribution, distribution.
But I would say that we're gonnaexplain some of these terms as we go.
If the terms are not totally clear,we'll try to de-jargonize them.
We're very, very, very contextualized,so raise you're hand ifyou feel we're too jargonyand we'll slow down and explain stuff.
- [Reid] Yeah, all right.
- All right.
Oh, wait.
Yeah, good.
- [Reid] Yeah?- [John] Yes.
So, I'm not obviously gonna read allof these questions, but thisis a subset of the questionsthat change as you scale an organization.
This is the kind of thing that you think,okay, are these the kinds of thingsyou make the decision onceat the very beginning?And then that persists as you move fromyou and your co-foundersto essentially thousandsand more of people in the company,and the answer is allof these things change.
The way that you do them,the way you think aboutthem, and they changeat these different ordersand magnitude of scale.
And it isn't that you tryto pre-program thembecause if you don't winat the game you're playing, you don'tget to play the next game, but if you seethat the next game is comingthen you can kind of be ready for it.
When you get to it, you get to it quickly.
You can exploit advantages that you see,relative to your competition,relative to capital.
And that's part of how this plays.
And so, for example--- [John] Sorry.
- [Reid] Oh, that's all right.
- [John] Yes.
- [Reid] No, no.
For example, one of the key ones ishow does hiring change as you scale?For example, Aneel Bhusri,who is the CEO and co-founder of Workday,he and his co-founder, David Duffield,who was the founder of PeopleSoft,interviewed every singleperson that joined the companyuntil there were 500 people because partof their insight was keepingculture is really importantand until you get thefirst 500 all locked in,they were gonna interviewon culture basis.
But even at 500, that changes.
Because they can't do that to 10,000.
- Although Larry and Sergey did itat least to 500, maybe more.
- Yes, exactly, so that's--- It's a little bitmythology, see, it's hardto tell exactly how long they did it.
- Yes, although, I think actuallyLarry still reviews a lot of the CVs.
- I think reviews.
- Yes. (laughs)(class laughs)- I'm gonna use air quotes a fair amountduring the class, too.
- Exactly.
- For example, another one that gets thisis how you should think about competition.
Frequently, when startup folks pitch VCs,what they say is, "Okay, well,"I'm worried about Google,I'm worried about Microsoft."Almost never as a startup isthat your real competition.
Your real competition isother startups, right?Because all organizationshave three to five thingsthat they're really targetingand unless you happen to say,"Actually, what I'm doingis I'm going after search,"then yes, you should worryabout Google as competition.
But if Google has one of its 200 productsand you happen to be competingin some angle for one of them,that's actually not thereally relevant issue.
However, as you begin toget to organizational scale,we're actually deploying,having a bunch of customers,having revenue stream,then the competitiontends to become much larger companies.
And it tends to be thatnot only are you competingwith startups or other folkswho may be in your class,but you're also competingwith the industry leadersin certain ways becausethere may have a leverageand they now may befocused more on your end.
And that's kind of asense of how these areand there's a ton of thesequestions and will will gothrough them as we'regoing through the class.
- It's hard to talk about scalewithout putting a little bitof specificity around itand these are super rough.
We're trying to think aboutorders of magnitude of company.
- Yeah, so, basic idea, metaphoris family, tribe, village, city.
It's on the order of magnitudeof number of employeesand there's actually a sub-themehere that's kind of 10sand threes and there'sa sub-theme of threesthat we'll also touch onlightly in some places.
But essentially it's, you know,you've kind of got your initial,like everyone in the room,everyone in, you know, kindof an apartment, right?Or large apartment, house, maybe.
And then it kind of goes up and this,everything changes as you go through this,but there's other scales that matter tooand this is all very rough,about your consumertraction, your B2B traction,your revenue traction.
And all of these relate.
And this is not meant to be that any timeyou're here, you should be here.
There's differentials aboutwhat your market may be,what your strategy maybe, what your competitionmay look like, such thatyou may be here and here.
You know, there may bevarious kinds of combinations,but it's partially what gives you a senseof where are you on thismassive scale evolution.
- Yeah, I guess the point is that,what we're trying to say is that,when it's three or fourfounders, it's a super differententerprise than it is when it's 15 people.
And somewhere between 15 and 100,things really change a lot too.
It's the same kind of dealwhere between zero revenueand the first million inrevenue, there are reallyprofoundly differentthings about the company.
Some things will be consistent,many themes will be consistent,but the activities and the work changes.
And so, like Reid says,it doesn't always read all the way across.
For example, WhatsAppobviously breaks the mold.
- [Reid] Yup.
- [John] Like 19 people,- [Reid] Instagram.
- 19 people and like 600million users or something.
You know, when we invested inKevin and Mikey in Instagram,he didn't have 13 people and they wereheaded towards 100 million users.
So, there are things that break the frame.
What we're really trying to say is usuallyemployees correlate with usersand revenue, give or take,there's a lot of things changing.
For this class, we're gonnatalk about organizational scalebecause it's the easiestfor us to talk aboutaround complexities around hiringaround how you gotta market,which means how yousell, and other things.
- Or how you distribute.
- Yup.
- Hold on, don't go to the next slide yet.
So roughly speaking we're gonnaspend two weeks per section.
It'll probably be extra focuson tribe, village, and city.
This week and next week areessentially the startup class,that's kind of the family, like how do youpull stuff together.
We'll go a little bit towho we selected to come inand why we did that towardsthe end of today's class.
But the idea is essentially how doyou essentially launchfrom that into this?And as you're thinkingabout entrepreneurship,how do you think about what this growthand what this journey looks like?And so we've roughly two weeks per stage.
And it'll depend a little bit onpeople's availability and time.
- Yeah, we tried hard toput together a pretty robustand amazing speaker list,people who I think will,we think we will give you guysthe most interesting insights,but the rough structure of theclass is Tuesday, Thursday,Tuesday, Thursday in a four-class section.
We'll do a lecture like this on the scaleand then the next weekclasses will be guest speakersfrom the outside who talkabout what it was likein their companies, togrow it, and we'll do a,often we have moderated conversation,so we'll have Jeff Weiner in for laterin the class for the very large company.
We'll have Selina Tobaccowala,who's a CS graduate, who's the presidentat SurveyMonkey come inin the village section.
We'll do that, but that'sroughly the section,and like Reid says, we'll reorganize itbecause some of these peopleare fairly painful to schedule.
And most of us will try tobe here for every class.
That won't always be the case'cause Reid has some travel,I've got some travel,Allen's got some travel.
Okay, ready?- So, this is a way of thinking about,and it's not exhaustive, butthis is a way of thinkingabout what we're walking through.
These say, here's the differentorganizational structuresand what happens whenyou're thinking aboutall of the different parts of a company.
So, people's obviously pretty fundamentalso it's what we start with.
But then also, are you a single-threadedor multi-threaded product company?Always, as a startup,you're single-threaded.
When do you get to multithreaded?How do you make that decision?How do you know it's coming upon you?How is your go-to-market?Is your go-to-market one simple thing?Is your go-to-market a plan that'syou know, an enterprise-based,a consumer-based,even there's differentiationwithin those plans.
Some enterprise is kind of classic,you know, heavy field sales.
Some enterprise is essentially telephony.
Some enterprise, like Slack,is an entirely new model.
And then part of that then gets downto what's your technology strategy?So, for example, frequently,in the beginning of a company,you actually, in fact, try,like one of the quotesthat some of my friends, although not,this one's not John, although I willprobably tease John occasionally,tell me that I will never live down is,that if you're not embarrassedby your product release,you've released too late.
The whole point of that quote is to saythe importance of speedand the importance of timeand your general get to market.
It does not mean that,for example, you'relaunching a hardware productand you're embarrassed byyour first product release,you're probably also dead, right?So, for consumer internet software,it's the importance of speed.
And part of that actually then gets downto what your text strategy isbecause you say, wellwe're gonna build superrobust technology and we'regonna have that technology fromthe very beginning and that'sgonna be our OS1 strategy,then a likelihood in a consumerinner base is you're likelyto be developing too slowly and you're notgetting the market fast enough.
And so, for example, withinconsumer internet companiesit tends to be the howdo you get the thing upand then how do yourebuild it as you're goingbecomes part of your technology strategy.
However, if you did thatthe whole way through here,then someone around here you're gonna diebecause you're not gonna be able to,that pattern, which made you win here,isn't gonna win here.
And at that point youactually start havingto think about how is itwe're building a platform?How does that platform actually makea development stack that makeseveryone more productive?How do we have toolsthat do it the right way?And all that sort of thing andthat's part of how you beginto look at what this range looks like.
- Yeah, so I think that'sactually, so that's the deal.
We're trying to put together a metaphoror a little bit of a chessboard,trying to think about howto go from nothing to areally big, robust company.
And if you think aboutmost of the startup schooland startup talks, they'reall focused on OS1.
How do you get the people,product, and go-to-market right?Maybe technology.
And if you think about just those things,then you tend to fall downin other places on the board.
And so we're trying tohelp you think aboutfour different types ofcompanies and we happento be best at consumer internetand enterprise software.
But four differentcategories of a company,how do you fill out the board?- Yup, and that's part of how,when you're thinking about,when you're listeningto the fireside chatsand the guest speakers and us,you should be thinking aboutwhat is in the positive columnto watch out for, whatis in the negative columnfor how you can die and how it plays in.
And this is only a partial list.
Part of the reason why thisleaves us new functionsis that part of a thing thathappens is suddenly you haveto start doing corp devand buying companiesand that becomes part of your strategy.
There's a bunch of thingsthat as you go across here,there's new functions.
And so, even though likehiring, you might hireyour first HR persons somewhere in hereand start doing an HR process here, right?Disagree?- GTM is sales and marketing, sorry.
- [Reid] Yes, you're right.
- [John] A jargon alert.
Yes, okay, all right.
But there's a bunch ofother new functions.
And so, now, particularlyto hit the inflection,most of the time thisis where you're actuallyfiguring out yourinflection and figuring outwhether or not you actually havea real blitzscale opportunity.
And sometimes you mayspend a bunch of time hereand sometimes you may move very quickly.
And so we're gonna focus pretty intenselyon this area, but you also needto see what's going on here.
Once we clear these twoweeks we won't go backto the startup stuffthat often 'cause we feelthat's relatively well covered in a numberof different classes at Stanford.
So, 10s, 100s.
And by the way, part of what this meanswhen you say ones, thisis actually probablyto roughly 12 to 15, thisis probably roughly to 150.
If any of you don't knowwhat Dunbar's number is,you should look it up,D-U-N-B-A-R. (laughs)And this is, essentiallygoes into the 100s,which is, call it 200to 500, 600 as a way,'cause it depends a little bit on howyou're operating exactlyand you know, kind ofglobal distribution and areyou scaling customer service,are you scaling your central productdevelopment organizationand a bunch of other things,but that's roughly what this is.
So here are some general observationswhen you look at the road aheadand part of the point of today's class isto give you some frame forthinking about what ournext lecture is and our nextconversation's gonna be.
So, first question is,when do you blitzscale?It is actually not in factthat you say I've got an ideaand I go find my couple of buddiesand I go blitzscale right away.
That is not actually what you do.
Maybe once out of 1,000 or 10,000.
But the question is, whatspeed you're operating atis partially an exercise injudgment and intelligenceabout what does thecompetition actually look like,what is the way you'regonna win 10-year game,because very rarely arethese games one-year games.
They're usually 10 plus year games.
Now, you may have to getahead of the competitionin the next year and the nextyear may be super intensivein terms of the way you do it,but what's the way to do that?And then, the question comes down to is,'cause if you, example, you decide to hitthe afterburners nowand your business modelisn't ready, your companyactually isn't ready,that's one of the ways that actuallyyou miss a curve and you die.
So it doesn't mean don't do it,'cause sometimes you haveto do it competitively,but that preparation forit and the judgment of itand the execution of blitzscalingactually really matters.
The next trend that you'llfind is that as you're goingthrough the orders of magnitude of scale,you're, generally speaking,moving from generalist to specialist.
It isn't that you ever get ridof generalist in a company,but when you start withthe first five people,you're doing everything, right?You're buying office supplies,you know, I'm heading out for pizza'cause the other folks are coding.
So my job is to go get the pizza.
Actually, we both did that on occasion.
And so, what you do though is everyoneis responsible for a number of things.
So even if you thinkabout technology stack,say, look I'm actuallybuilding the technology,you actually even havegeneralist technologists.
Like if you have someone who says, "Look,"all I'm really good at is kernel code,"well, if you're building an application,that's not gonna help you that much.
So you are looking for,in the early stages,people who are much more generalist,much more flexible because you alsomay be moving around interms of the classic jargon.
Although accurate jargon nowpivots and everything else,you may be trying to figureout what you're doing,so you need people who will do thingsthey're not comfortablewith, learn it quickly, etc.
But as you scale, you willhire more and more specialists.
Specialists at technology,specialists at sales,specialists at management,all these sorts of things.
And that goes to the third path, which isas you scale, you will movefrom everyone in the room doing,and doing just about anythingthat needs to be done,to some people who aredoing and some peoplewho are both managingand doing, also doing,to, okay, some peoplewho are just managingand eventually to executives.
And part of what executive is,as you get to an executive,your primary functionbecomes the organization.
How do you compose them?How do you have them operate as a team?How do you essentiallyhave, scaling people up?How do you have onboarding?All of the rest of that.
It's not like, oh, I articulate visionand I stand at the helmand point in a direction.
That's usually a pretty useless executive.
It's actually people who areworking on the organization.
And so you'll see that as a pattern.
Another one is, is it isn'tthat you do innovation firstand then everything else isthis kind of thoughtless scale.
It almost never works that way.
You actually are in factworking to preserve your abilityto be innovative as you'rescaling the organization.
Because there's lots of thingsthat you need to innovate on.
You need to innovate onhow you're managing data,you need to innovate onwhat is your go-to-marketand how are you transforming the waythat you're acquiring customers.
You may be innovatingdepending on, you know,consumer companies tendto be a lower numberof product lines,enterprise tend to be more.
Again, all of these thingsare heuristics, not rules.
But you may be innovating onhow that's functioning too.
And so you have to both scalewhile you maintain innovation.
You also frequentlywill encounter a choiceof are you preserving adaptabilityor are you doing operational excellence?And part of what business isand kind of theory of capitalism,very good at it is saying,look, how do you driveyour unit costs down,how do you make it moreefficient to produce a service,to provide a service, moreproductivity on the employee.
It's kind of a classictailor industrial metrics.
Those are still valuable,but part of when you're operating at speedand kind of doing this kind of blitzscale,sometimes you actually makechoices on adaptability,you actually have wastage.
You actually go, "That's okayif hired way too many people."So, for example,one, kind of early PayPal story,so this is, you know, Peter Thieland Max Levchin, co-founders.
We were growing at between 2% and 5%of userbase and transactions per day.
And I presume that mostpeople in this roomhave good enough math toknow how that compounds.
- [John] Fast.
- So we,(laughs) yes, right.
- [Reid] So that basicallymeant that we were goingin the hole, and by the second weekwe were going 20,000 newcustomer service emailsin the hole per week and growing.
That led to essentially having,we were only listed in Palo Alto.
Enough angry customersthat they figured outwhich city we were in, theywere dialing extension numbersin the office at random and 24 hours a dayyou could pick up the phoneand talk to an angry customer.
(class laughs)All right.
So when we're dealing withthat kind of scale issuebecause the product iscanning away from us,the way that we dealt this iswe weren't going operationalexcellence, we're like,"Oh my God, we've gotta solvethis problem right away."So what we did is we literally flew,we decided to build a customerservice center in Omahaand we literally flew outgroups of employees todo group interviewingof customer service,so that within two monthswe would have a 200-personcustomer service departmentrunning to answer that.
We churned out about70% of those employeeswithin three months'cause of churning through'cause we were doing the oppositeof operational excellence,but we were focused on getting it upand adapting as we were going.
And that's a frequentchoice that you will makein sales, technology,customer service, etc.
The sixth one is global reach,which is essentially the fact thatas a part of the networked age,you're global faster than you imagine.
So, one example,when we launched LinkedIn,we had 12 companies in the?12? 15?It was some, no, no, countries.
It was 12 or 15 countriesin the dropdown list.
- [Allen] 15.
- [Reid] 15.
And we added them as wegot people complaining,"My country is not in it."That list got long very fast.
And what's more, even though, you know,reasonably educated, I camehere along with many of you.
Like Faroe Islands, I didn't actuallyreally know it was a country. (laughs)Right, remember looking up Faroe Islands?Yeah, like okay.
So, you get to global reach much faster.
Capital requirements.
You basically cannot blitzscalewithout heavy available capital.
And that comes from one of two mechanisms.
That either comes froma good revenue modelthat you're reinvesting orit comes from capital marketsthat are essentially flowing.
Now that doesn't mean youcan't blitzscale only,are you--- [John] Capital markets are...
- [Reid] Oh, financing.
- Venture capital.
Debt.
- [Reid] Yeah, yeah.
- [Chris] IPOs.
- Ways of getting money. (laughs)Although IPOs are more than that too.
And so you have to havecapital in order to do that.
Now, you can blitzscaleeven in down marketsbecause it's a relative metric.
Speed is relative andso it's just a questionof how do you movefaster in a networked agethan available competition.
- Yeah, this is a super current debateand if you look at almostany blogs of VCs right now,there's like a lot ofpeople ringing their handsabout the environment andI think this is legitimate.
It's a very overheated environment,things are very expensive,lots of companiesare raising big rounds.
And so lots of VCs, including us,we're starting to getconcerned about burn rates.
And so the conversation will be,well, the tension isbetween how much you spendand whether you can go win the market.
And so, you get into this funny cycleof trying to win themarket, but also not tryingto increase burn rate,which is how much moneyyou're sending out the door every month.
And so, it's a real tensionand it's a very, very current question.
And Uber, Lyft, all these guys,everybody who's growing is looking at,and it's balanced between unit economics,which is how much money doyou make on each transactionor lose on each transactionversus how much money do youspend to go take the market.
- And if your burn rategets out of control,and then the capital, youdon't have enough revenueand the capital market's done up,that's another way, whichin the first internet boomwas a way that you had internet winner.
That's the kind of thingthat blows companies up.
- [John] It's a prize, poof.
- Yes.
So I think that's good enough'cause we've talked about eight and nine.
- [John] All right.
- [Chris] We should goa little more quickly.
- Yes.
So this is a high line ofkind of thinking about how,kind of roughly speaking.
We'll publish theseslides so you don't needto take notes on them and so forth.
But it's kind of a way of thinking aboutwhat happens when you'regoing between themand we'll return to these themesas we're going through them.
Obviously, right nowwe're in the family area.
- [Voiceover] Great.
- Okay, so hey everybody.
I wanted to give a, kind of a brief,I want to give some meat to the storythat just got told aboutthose operational stages,or those organizational stages.
Here's one thing you gotta keep in mindas we go through all this stuff,there is no one story.
Every single company that'spassed through this stuffhas passed through many different paths,some of whom we wouldn'teven find it familiar,we wouldn't recognize it at LinkedIn,but you might recognizeit at Workday or wherever.
So I'm gonna tell a littlestory about how we passedthrough these phases for LinkedInto try to give you an idea ofwhat it actually feels liketo be in each place andsome of the decisionsthat we actually made, andhopefully it'll make someof that stuff, andwe'll actually come backto that list of one through fivebecause a lot of thethemes line up really well.
At LinkedIn, we wereone of those companiesthat did not blitzscale at the beginning.
So basically, at the verybeginning of the company,we spent two years in phase one,which for a company likeInstagram or WhatsApp--- Did you already explainwhat the lines are?- Oh yeah, well, I'm notgonna spend too much time on these.
You can see sort of the length of it,but it took us a little over 12 yearsto get where we are right now.
When you go next.
- And also, this is the thingthat you're talking about,the two years of--- [Allen] Yup, exactly.
- [John] Employees,revenues, and all that stuff.
- Yeah, so give me the first picture.
So these guys are the originalwell, most of the originalfounding crew of LinkedIn.
This was our household back in the day.
This is in 2003 and 2004.
And basically, we started the whole thingwith a single idea.
And I should explain, really quickly.
You're gonna see a whole bunch of picturesthat look like this'cause we got a tradition,starting with this photographthat when we reach majormilestones in terms of user growth,and you'll understandwhen I'm done with thiswhy user growth was so important to us,we would take a picture of the peoplewho are working at thecompany, holding up the numberof people who were in the network.
So you're gonna see severalvariations on that during this.
Back then, we had a single ideaof what we were actually trying to do.
We discussed it in 2002 and in 2003we set out with this idea.
If you could build a professional networkwith reputable relationships inside of it,it would be useful for athousand different thingsthat professionals actuallydo on a regular basis.
That was the whole theorybehind what we were doing.
So we made it searchableand the idea is when weget to a certain numberof people, then peoplewould start using itfor search on a regularbasis and it would becomea new way of doing business.
That was basically the idea.
Everybody we hired were peoplewe had worked with before.
These were all friendsor former colleagues.
Sorry about the notes.
The organization itself wasas lightweight as possible.
Literally we were borrowing the roomsthat we took this photograph in.
And basically we hadonly the absolute minimumfor building out general administrative,we had, oh--- [Reid] Might wanna tellthe story of the whiskey--- If I have time I'll tell youthe story about the whiskey.
So we had only the absolutebasics for making things happen.
So basically all of oureffort, every single momentof every day was for solving one problem,which is, what's gonnabe valuable to the user?That was literally all we thought about.
And nothing else mattered.
We did everything else atthe minimum level possible.
We released in May of 2003.
We immediately began learning aboutwhat product-market fitactually meant for us.
People familiar with the conceptof product-market fit in general,just the idea that basicallyyou're providing a productwhich provides value outinto the market at scale.
That's basically the idea.
We didn't really know, wehad a theory, a hypothesisabout what the market fitwas actually gonna be,but what we found out wasthat it was different.
So we put it out there and it becameimmediately obvious thatrecruiters were gonna love it.
However, in order to get to that place,we had to build a critical mass of peoplefor those recruiters to search.
So we had our first notionof what product-market fitactually felt like, what wedidn't have is the userbasenecessary to be able to drivethat product-market fit.
And that was what we discoveredduring our very first version.
It was about discovering that fit.
The second version, next.
There we are again.
You can see the team'sa little bit bigger.
We had to build this teamout because basicallywe had realized what theproduct-market fit actually wasand now we needed to build thatminimal operation necessaryfor us to actually beable to attack that fit.
So you can see these areactually the three co-founders.
There I am and Reid,who wore his hair longerback in the day, and Jean-Lucwho was our original head of engineering.
Basically,we found ourselves in a place where we hadto go from 12 employees toroughly 30 or 40 employeesto be able to support things.
We also added a set of new functions,new things that we didn't haveto worry about as a startup.
Those were customer service,and we added sales, so thego-to-market componentsthat John mentioned a little bit earlier,and we added minimal GNA,the general administrative functions,to be able to do things like cut paychecksand manage benefits for employees.
So just the minimal stuffthat we actually needed to do.
Next.
Okay, here we are again.
Now we're in the parking lot'cause we no longer fit in the building.
13 million users at this point.
I'm way in the back there.
In the village, for us,this became a place where we wanted to tryto do two things simultaneously.
So we wanted to be able to take advantageof the existing fit, it was a builda great recruiter business,but we also neededto explore additional fits.
Basically, we had a greatfit with recruiters,which only representsabout half of a percentof all professionals, but we knew we hada value propositionfor every professional.
So the question is howare you actually gonnago out and find that?So in 2007 we broke our organization apartand we added at on of extra overheadbecause we needed to divideour R&amp;D organization up into parts.
So we went from one R&amp;D organizationto five R&amp;D organizations.
Five? Five.
And for what it's worth, we still havefive R&amp;D organizations at LinkedIn.
- [Reid] That was the tracks,you're referring to tracks.
- These are tracks, right.
Each one had a differentof things they supported,either they supported thegrowth of an existing businessor they explored new stuff.
It was our way of trying to balanceoperational excellence with adaptability.
We wanted to make sure we had fourof those organizations out,one of those organizationsfocused on growth, one focused on revenue,and the other three focusedon what would be valuable,what other product-marketfits actually existedto continue to allow us to grow.
That required new leadership.
When you get a company thatbig, we're now at 120 people,at 120 people, you need a different typeof organizational leadership.
So we brought in a CEO.
Guy's name was Dan Nye.
He came from Intuit.
And he came in with tremendous knowledgeabout building enterprisebusinesses and sales businesses.
He had worked on QuickBooks and a bunchof other things for small businesses.
He was extremely knowledgeableabout that stuff.
He came in and put all the effort into make a sales organization really workbecause it was our abilityto capture that marketplace.
But simultaneously we had tobring in brand new productand engineering leadershipto be able to runthose five simultaneouslines of development.
- That's one of the thingswe're gonna talk about,I think a little bit during the class'cause most people SiliconValley talk about founder or CEO.
I was a founder, I hireda CEO to replace me.
Reid was a founder, hired to replace him,then unreplaced himself,then replaced himself again as CEO.
- Indecisive.
- Yeah, Reid is totally indecisive.
- So I think that knowingwho to put in what jobs,and especially the CEO, withrespect to the founders,and we'll talk aboutthrough the quarter I think.
- All right, so next.
All right, the city.
So now, we're in a totallydifferent parking lotbecause now we're talking abouthundreds and hundreds of employees.
In 2009 we basically began blitzscaling.
We hadn't really done it up to this pointbecause remember, growthwas our main limiter.
If we didn't have a big network,we weren't gonna be able to drive stuff.
So basically,we had to bring all these people in for usto be able to basically take advantageof the growth we hadachieved up to that pointand continue to drive our effortsin those five product lines.
But at that point, therewere changing expectationsfor the way that our customerswere using our products.
So we had a recruiterproduct, we had sales product,we had marketing solutionsproducts, wide variety of thingsand now the bar had to beraised on all of that stuff.
We had to have peoplemanaging those relationships.
We had to have sales people outthere generating new things.
A lot of our customer growthwas coming from overseas.
So now we're beginning tosee growth outside the US.
So we brought in a new CEO to do this,this is Jeff Weiner who'll bewith us later in the quarterto talk about this process,leading from stage four into stage five.
Jeff came in and thevery first thing he didwas he prepared us to blitzscale.
So one thing we had never doneand this is a great learning for us,is we'd never writtendown our company culture.
We hadn't written down our strategybecause we were too small.
We didn't have to do that.
You'll find, if you haven'tworked in a startup,that when you're a startup,everyone knows everything all the time.
But when you're a big companyyou have different managementand executive leadership needs.
So Jeff came in, hewrote all that stuff downand it's still the waywe run the company today.
We're 8,500 employees now.
Okay, we basically doubledsize year over year over yearfrom 2009 to 2014.
Okay.
Something else that happened here.
As those of you who've workedin a startup which lasts a long time know,when you work on a codebasefor more than six years,it becomes full of gunk.
Okay.
We had tremendous technicalchanges we needed to maketo make sure that we have thetechnical platform necessaryto make the thing successful.
So we had to change ourtechnology strategy at this point.
We had to think aboutbasically building for scale,for flexibility, fordeveloper productivity,a whole bunch of thingswe'd never considered beforebecause we now had hundredsof developers working on stuffand still had to drive tobe able to move quickly.
Finally, we had to change ourfinancing strategy at this point.
So we had been doing financing,basically we became profitable in 2006,but now we were thinking abouthow do you bring togetherthe capital that youneed in order to be ableto do things like acquisitions.
So not only did we go out fora seed round at this time,but we also did the IPO in 2011in order to make sure that we were readyto make necessaryacquisitions along the way.
Next.
So this is a small group of people.
This is in our new San Francisco officewhen we crossed the 300 million,see 300 million is back there,we crossed the 300 million mark.
This was one of the major changes we saw.
Our development organization is now splitacross many geographies for the first timein the company's history.
We now have as many employees workingoutside the United States aswe do inside the United States.
We are in 27 different countries,we have major operations in China,we have people spread all around the worldmaking LinkedIn happen.
We also have 8,500 employees,more than $2 billion ofrevenue and so forth,so again the set of requirementshas actually changed.
So this is the kind of thingthat we're talking about,this is the LinkedIn story andwe'll have lots more detailas people desire it andas you wanna add later onbecause this is a very,very high level description,but there's no clean path which gets youfrom one thing to the next,but knowing these changesand how those needs changeover time is the main thingthat we wanna get out of this.
So we can talk specificallyabout some of those thingsand we're gonna be doingit with every guestwho comes and talks about thestage they're actually at.
- And the point is not to make thisthe LinkedIn story, obviously.
The point is to give you an illustrationof one example of how thesecompanies actually changeand what are the thingsyou need to succeed atin order to succeed in buildingan interesting company.
- Any questions so far?Any questions now?All right, so 20 moreminutes and then we're good.
So, just quickly.
The next two weeks areabout the family stage.
It's about having a team, small teamtry to find product-market fit.
And so, the things you careabout are mostly these.
Is your product any good?Does anybody care thatyour product's good?What do you do everyday?- [Reid] Other than you.
- [John] What's that?- [Reid] Other than you.
- [John] Yeah, and your mom and your dad.
They love your product, of course.
Who do you hire and howthe hell do you get themto work for you, when they can go work forFacebook or Dropbox or hot startups Xor go to Y Combinatorand be their own founder.
How do you get anybody,not just customers to care,how do you get any employees to care?And then how do you makesure you can pay people?Anything you wanna add here?- [Reid] Nope.
- This is it.
This is about all you cancare about at this stage.
Things that are not veryrelevant, they're kind of key,like who's in charge andhow do you have analytics,how do you tell howyou're doing, strategy,but in truth, you're notgonna do any of this stuffbecause it's not nearly asimportant as these other things.
Product, product, product.
People, people, people.
Making sure you can pay.
That's it.
There's nothing else at this stage.
- One of the key thingswhen you're lookingat these different scales is not onlywhich problems do you solve,but which problems do you not solve.
Part of the entrepreneurial journey,and that happens even whenyou're at scales of thousands,is there are fires burningwhen you're going home.
That's fine.
You have to know whichfires it's okay to go home,it's like, yeah, we can dealwith that one next week,right, that's fine,and which ones you can't.
In the family, OS1,these are some of the thingsthat are absolutely criticaland if you're not obsessedabout them every single day,you are most likely gonna fail.
- Yeah, I mean, I would Reidis probably better at thisthan anybody that I know,which I call triaging,which is knowing what to takecare of and what to ignore.
And when Reid ignores somethinghe totally ignores it.
So there are things if you,I mean, he has these characteristicssome of my other partners do, which isif you send them mail and they give a damnabout the mail, they'llrespond in about 18 seconds.
If they don't and theydon't respond in 18 seconds,forget it, you're nevergonna get a response backbecause it's below the triage line.
So I think that the key for this stage isknow what's important and if stuff,I tend to be worse at it than Reid.
I tend to say, oh myGod, here's my todo list,"I'd really like tofinish these other thingsthat are maybe not totallypriority, but they're uncheckedand I'd really like to check that box.
So it's a little bitStanfordy in that way.
But Reid is pretty goodat letting fires burnand letting fires burn is pretty keyif they're the right fires.
- Yeah.
Letting the wrong fires burn obviously isanother fatality.
- [John] Pretty bad, yes.
- [John] Another fatality, yeah.
- Go back to the other one.
There's a lot of things that all,and there's a ton that fitsinto four, everything else.
There's a lot of things thatgo into building a company.
You do not presolve problems.
So, for example, it's veryrare in the family stagethat your data is gonnabe key to your success.
It's very likely that asyou get to the village,maybe even the tribe, thedata's gonna be essential.
So, it shifts.
Here, who cares?And I have a basic dashboard,how many people signed up,how many people downloadedthe app, whatever.
You know, like fine, fine.
Or understanding your exact link.
As you're beginning to get into itthat will move from tenth to second.
Or something, it depends on theexact company and what you're doing.
Likewise you're gonna iterate through,like strategy's always important,but the fact is, if you're only thinkingand talking about your strategy,that's actually not gonna play out.
You need to actually have a dispositionto getting in the fight, to doing things.
That's part of the, "Ifyou're not embarrassed"by your first product release,you've released too late."There are very few productgeniuses, who just think itand then launch it and it works.
Very, very few.
So if you presume you're one of them,it's a high bit of strategy.
Maybe it'll work, probably won't.
- Part of what happensis trying to get anybodyto use it is a pretty Herculean effort,trying to get the thingto compile, then ship,and then released in the app store,and getting anyone to use it,you have to do hand-to-handcombat in a lot of ways.
Once you do that, if itstarts to work at all,the system, the app, thepeople, and all the usersbecome too big for youto hold in your headand that's why data starts to become moreand more important over time.
- And one great thing that's changed a lotin the last few years, you all arein a much better environmentto be able to handle this.
And the reason that's true is that so manyof the things whichare, in fact, not vitalare now things you can get off the shelf.
For instance, the wholeidea of provisioning a colois something that we had to do.
We literally, in our first office,we were sitting on thebox, instead of chairswe had boxes of hardware that we weregonna take to our colo, okay.
That no longer happens.
Now, that problem, which is notan important problem at all,it's a necessary thing,but it's not important,is something you can do just by signing upfor Amazon Web Services.
So you've got it much better.
The good thing is, allthe things you don't wantto focus on, many of you don't have to.
The thing is that the things you do haveto focus on are still really hard.
- Yeah, the bad news is everybodyelse gets to do that too.
- Yes, exactly- So you're competing witheverybody who has the same thing.
- So this is my favorite essay about OS1by a guy, Paul Graham,who started Y Combinator.
His essay is Do Things That Don't Scale.
And so this will be homeworkfor Thursday's class.
There'll be three things to read,two things by Sam Altman,one by Paul Graham.
But this is the essaythat I think everybodyshould pay real attention to.
And what he tells is stories aboutwhen you're just starting out,like you might have togo grab somebody's phoneand install the app for themand then show them how to use it.
That obviously won't scale toeven 100 users or 1,000 users,but getting the first user is critical,getting the second user is critical.
And so he tells us a storyabout Airbnb doing thingsthat didn't scale when they startedand I don't know if you know it.
Do you know any of those stories?- I know a lot of the stories.
- Do you wanna tell any of the Airbnb?- So, for example, one thing isthey went door to door in New Yorkto sign up people's, theyidentify 'em off Craigslist's,they got in touch with themand they went and said,"You should go post in Airbnb."So the founders showed upand said, "Hey, this is why"you should be listeningon my marketplace."They then also began to realizethat the trust and qualityof the transactions reallyhad a lot to do withdo I see a place that I like?So they would pay photographersto go take pictures of those places.
Those are all kinds ofthings that the founderswere doing at the very beginning.
And when you're doing that,you're not writing code,you're not buying marketing,you're not interviewing and hiring people.
That's all a bunch of stuffthat is massively time intensive.
Now, of course, whenyou're in the family stage,you will tend to be workingprobably casually 100 hours,120 hours a week, maybe even more.
So, that's fine, butit's a choice of howyou're putting the timeand those were allthings that was necessaryto get to the initial critical massto have a value propositionthat people say,"Oh yeah.
"This is actually something I would use."- It's critical for so many reasons.
It gives you a sense of whatactual customers look likeand feel like and what they care about.
It does modeling for all the employees,it does modeling for your customers,it helps everything.
Doing things that don't scale,maybe you will do itlater, maybe you won't.
Craig Newark did customer servicethe whole time he was at Craigslist.
- [Reid] I think his title's stillChief Customer Service Rep.
- Yeah, so some peoplelike doing that forever,but it's critical at the beginning,so we'll have you read that.
This is Mozilla and this is my story.
I got there sort of rightwhen the orange started,so obviously highlycorrelated with winning.
(class laughs)- [Reid] Taking personal responsibility.
- Totally causal.
No, so, all I wanted to say is look,this story, you're gonnasee it again and again,which is, people kind off to the left,kind of wandering around,trying to make a thingthat they think is important.
And then you start to geta little bit of traction,some people care.
And then you start to figure a thing out.
In this case, they figured out howto build a quick, fast webbrowser right at the right timewhen IE, Internet Explorer,none of you probably use it anymore,really started to not be very good.
And so they were buildingasset, building asset,building asset and thenthe context happenedthat they could blitzscale.
And I was employed 12 or 15,right at the beginning there,but it was right at thebeginning of us blitzscalingand we got to be about 400 million usersover the next three or four years.
Anyways, we're gonna see chart after chartthat looks like this, whichis slow, slow, slow, fast.
- Can I actually goback for just a second?'Cause this is the thingto actually really pay attention to.
'Cause this is the thingto actually really pay attention to.
This isn't just the compounding graph,this is organization, uncertainty,the fog of what's going on in the market,all the rest that goes into this.
And that's part of whatyou meant by decisioning,on when are you tryingto hit the accelerator.
- Yeah, yep.
Yeah, if they had triedto hit the acceleratorany other time, it justwouldn't have worked.
They would've spent money andthey wouldn't have happened.
Hitting the acceleratorthen was a profoundlyuncomfortable thing anone of the things iswhen you're starting to blitzscale,it's uncomfortable all the time.
You're not doing anythingwell except just tryingto keep the wheels orthe wings on the plan,I guess is the metaphor I'd use.
But all these charts look the same.
Here's Airbnb.
Airbnb had a long period overhere on the left of the graph.
Before 2010 it was just flat.
And again, they were building assets,they were creating momentum,creating a community,so that by 2011 when conditionsstarted to get right,it started to work really well.
So, here's the first couple of weeks.
So 9/22's today.
Welcome.
Thursday we'll have Sam Altman come inand do a reprise of hisclass from last year.
One of the assignmentswe'll have you to donext day or so, is in the LinkedIn group,which we'll tell you how to do,put down questions you'd likeus to ask Sam during class.
So it'll be an hour and a half of Sam.
Sam, he was here at Stanford,he dropped out of Stanford,founded Loopt, now he runs YCombinator, probably the mostimportant startuporganization in the world.
This is no joke.
He sees thousands andthousands of new ventures,he helps, actively, hundreds.
There's nobody quite inthe same position as Sam.
And so what we're gonna ask him to dois of all the things he sees,especially this organizational stage one,what does he see around commonalities?- [Reid] Yeah, patterns orwork patterns that fail.
- Yup.
So Sam, we're gratefulthat he's gonna come out.
So, that's the content for today.
We have two more slides.
Here's how the class is gonnawork, I'll come back to it.
And then here's whatto read for next week.
Does anybody have anyquestions before we talkabout mechanics and class logistics?- [Voiceover] (mumbles) thatbinds to consumer internet.
Do you think B2B is gonnabe equally relevant here?- Yeah, we'll talk about enterprise,we call it enterprise software or B2B.
Today, you got a lot of consumer internet.
Reid and I both, Reid, Allen, we all,well, LinkedIn is I thinka good canonical companyof one that lives in both worldsof consumer and enterprise.
We do a lot of that.
I think it'll depend on the guests,especially when they come.
- You should mention Reactivity, too.
- Yeah, I had an,well, it's kind of a longstory, but I had an enterprisesoftware company we sold to Cisco, too.
Plus Dropbox- [Reid] Plus guests.
- [John] and Quip and some others.
- [Reid] The goal is to be appropriate,although we will, we know consumer betterand it tends to get bigger,so there'll probablydisproportionate time on consumer,but we will cover B2B as well.
Yeah, and in fact, we also have onebiotech guest as wellwho's coming later in the,we can mention, yeah?- [Reid] Yeah.
- Yeah, so Elizabeth Holmes,who is the founder and CEOof Theranos is gonna come,which we're pretty excited about.
She doesn't talk a lot in public,so that should be an interesting one too.
And it's quite different domain.
- So question is, are theseblitzscaling strategiesequally applicable when youget out of the software realm?There's essentially threeparts to the answer to that.
The first part is, it's allabout speed differential.
So the question is, is movingfaster than your competitionis still important, thepure blitzkrieg that a,sorry, I hate that term.
I shouldn't use that term.
Blitzscale! (laughs)That will get edited.
(class laughs)- [John] That'll be a running joke,you can always edit in post.
- [Reid] Yes, exactly.
- [John] Except when you can't.
- [Reid] Yeah, exactly.
The pure blitzscale part ofthis is a differential speedbetween what's going on in the markets,what the competition lookslike, and how you play.
And so, it still plays on hardware.
Second thing is, many hardware,or call 'em atoms,businesses and industries arebeing more affected by bits.
So there's software and medicine,there's software and genetics.
There's software in hardware delivery,where the software is thekey part of the differential.
And so there's more ways that softwareaffects these other industries,so that also just picks up the entirecompetitive clock in that industry.
So, for example, what makesTesla interesting is not so muchthat it's an electriccar, it's a software car.
That's the thing that makes it interestingand that starts what'sreally picking it up.
And then the third part of it is,there are some thingsthat will be different.
So, for example, inhardware or things like itor medicine or other things,you have to have a much,much lower error rate.
But that's still something you say,well, okay, how do we move a little fasterthan the competitionwith a low error rate?As opposed to we can justaccept a high error rateas a way of doing it'cause one of the thingsyou'll see frequently in softwareis you'll accept a higher error rate.
For example, you'llaccept customer servicethat essentially responds through email,like, take the PayPal case.
Three weeks later!As opposed, and theydon't do that anymore,but that was during the growth period.
As a way of hacking which problemsyou need to solve in order to scale.
Now, in kind of classic,whether it's biology orhardware or everything else,you actually have tohave a much lower, lower,much lower error rate.
But that still can play into it.
- You'll get judged on whatare called comps, comparables.
And so people will, to theextent that you don't havecompetition that'sdirect, people will try tobaseline how your progressis going against others.
But I think the critical questions areare you selling your productand are you hiring well enough?And not a lot more--- The other key thing ofthis is you actually do notoverly focus on your competition anyway.
The real thing that smartfounders, smart executives,smart investors are doing is saying,will you own the market opportunity?Are you moving fast enough to do that?Are you building out thefoundation such that it's durable?The key question oncompetition is if someone elseowns that market opportunity before you,then you're clearly not gonna own it.
So when you get to thecompetition is not close to you,what you're actuallybeginning to think about is,okay, how are you building somethingthat will compound over time,not do you get there really fast.
And is that strong, now, of course,one metric is that ifyou're moving really slowly,the fact that you're gonnacompound, get big laterbecomes a little bit in doubt,not necessarily fully in doubt.
So, those are all thethings and this is partof the reason why it's not pure science.
There's a lot of judgmentthat goes in each specificand part of the reason youcan't just give out a roadmapis because part of what you're doingas a founder, as an executive,is you're exercising judgment.
One of the things we havehere in Silicon Valleyis essentially a network of learning,so one of the things you should always dois talk to all thesmart people around you,not just people who have done it before,but also other smartpeople because if thatmakes your decision crisper,then you make that decision much better.
Like how fast should be moving,how much capital should be,should we make the hire early,should we make the hire late.
Those kinds of questions arethe things that you're hittingas you're going into scale.
- And an example for thatfrom the LinkedIn story.
We didn't pay attention to the competitionparticularly at all early in the periodand the reason was, is thatwe were concentrating onwas the thing which was gonna allow usto completely win themarket down the line.
So if we were able to buildup the largest collectionof professionals together in one place,it actually kind of didn't matter.
If we got that first, even if we didn'thave the business set up yet,the people who are alreadyconcentrating on monetizing,it was gonna be fine.
So basically we wereconcentrating on that stuffand it allowed us to nottake our eye off that balland continue to be successful.
What people are looking for,is are you building somethingwhich will have the asset necessaryfor you to dominate themarket down the line.
- Most of our early competitorsat LinkedIn are companiesthat don't exist anymoreand they were all focusedon selling the corporations.
- Yup.
- Okay, so, we're gonna, just quicklyabout mechanics of the class.
We're gonna use LinkedIn groups,we're gonna use Medium collections,and we're gonna have someassignments and reading.
So the way it's gonna work is we're gonnasend everybody an invitationto the LinkedIn group.
That's where I'll post questionsand thought things, have discussions.
And we'll ask you each to postyou know, questions for Sam Altmanor answer some questions aboutthe content of the weekor something like that.
Additionally, we'd like people,it's optional, but very, very recommended,to put some of the workyou do in class on Medium.
And the reason we'd like to do that,number one is I thinkeverything gets betterwith visibility andinteraction and being public.
Some of Blake Master'swork on Peter Thiel's classtwo years ago I think isvery, very indicative of thisas if you do good work,you write good things,lots of good things accrue.
And so the idea is that for workif you're opt-in on Medium,we'll look at your assignments,I mean, we'll post themall to collections,they'll all be visible to the public,but then we'll also curatesome of the best workand to amplify that work throughLinkedIn and Twitter andFacebook and what have you,so I think it'll get you more attentionwhen you've done good work and that's,I think, a good, virtuous cycle.
So that's the rough way we're gonna workand we'll have more explicit instructionsin the LinkedIn group itself.
So these are the three thingswe'd like you to read for next week.
This'll be in the LinkedIn group.
One essay by Paul Graham I mentioned,Do Things That Don't Scale.
Startup Advice, Briefly, by Sam Altman,which is all of his advice, condensedinto one fantastic blog post.
And then Why Silicon Valley Works.
That's all we have todayand it is- [Allen] One minute to go!- [John] 40 seconds to go.
All right, so I think that's it.
- So thanks for the firstday, we'll see you soon.
- Thank you.
