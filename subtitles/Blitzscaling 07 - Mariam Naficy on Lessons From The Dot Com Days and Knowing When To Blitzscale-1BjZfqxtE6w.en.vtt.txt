WEBVTTKind: captionsLanguage: en- [Reid] It is my great privilegeand honor to have Mariamwith us today.
She is a serial entrepreneur.
She's done this multipletimes successfully.
She is also experienced inboth the first internet boom,and whatever we call thecurrent thing we're in.
- The endless boom.
- And you know, has beenon various lists, you know,Fortune most powerful women entrepreneurs,etc. etc., blah lists.
And one of the part of thedesign of this was, as you notedlast week, we actually hadsomething of a notion thatone of the ways that evensmall start ups can actuallyblitzscale and scale veryquickly is through the deploymentof communities.
And it's one of the thingsthat Mariam has donevery successfully withinthe commercial realm.
And so we thought thatwas another part of theinteresting arc, especiallywhen you're dealing with the,essentially the tribe stageof what kinds of thingscould be very relevant.
So why don't we just veryquickly touch on kind ofthe first business, Eve, right?- Um hmm, Eve.com.
- Yes, exactly.
What got you into it?How many employees did you get to?What was a little bit ofthe kind of the story ofthe first internet boom, andkinda what lessons did youlearn from it that you carried forward?- So I was on the Stanfordcampus in the basement ofthe GSP Building on a payphone, believe it or not,no cellphone, so I wasactually using the pay phone.
And I was calling a bestfriend of mine in New Yorkand saying come out with me.
There's venture capital money available.
I've been through banking,I've been through consulting.
There's no way I'm going toprogress through these ranks.
I've gotta work for myself.
I'm not interviewing for any jobs,so come and start a business with me.
She was my roommate whilewe were in banking together,Varsha Rao.
And she said, I'll come out there.
I'll leave Mackenzie, I'llmove into your tiny littleapartment and sleep on yourcouch, but only if we startwhat I wanna start, which isthis online cosmetics business.
And I wanted to do online market research.
I love market research anddata and surveys and stuff,but I said sure.
You know, I use cosmetics,how hard can it be?I don't anything about it,we might as well start.
So that was a very different time.
It was '98.
We went out and raised, inthe first year and a half,$26 million dollars.
We were, I think I was 28, yeah 28,and we built it reallyfast because it was reallya land grab mentally.
It was who's gonna get mindshare in the consumer'smind first as the firstonline cosmetics destination?And it was a very simple business,now that I think about itbecause you had to goconvince all the brands togive you distribution,put it in a warehouse,pick and pack it, and makesure all consumers understoodthat you were the destinationfor online cosmetics.
And we grew it very rapidly,120 people, six months.
I think we hired the entireexecutive team in six months,and 120 people, and all ofa sudden we're in the middleof Market Street with this fancy office,and like a 10-person Board,Bill Gross from Idealab,a bunch of other people.
And then all of a sudden,Sephora LVMH approached usto buy us within, I thinkbefore we even launchedthey wanted to get us outof there because they weretrying to launch Sephora in the U.S.
So they were really concerned about us,so the tried to buy us before we launched.
We said, look, we're justtrying to launch this business.
So they literally triedto buy us the monthbefore we launched, thenthe month after we launched,and finally in December tried again.
And we thought, OK well,by this point we're justnine months into it, we'rerising a series D, OK?This is the craziness of the environment.
And we noticed that it wasstarting to get a little hard.
This is early 2000, sothis is about a yearafter we launched.
We spent about a yearbuilding it, we launched.
Early 2000 they say, we wannabuy you, and we thought,OK, it's getting a littleharder to raise a series D.
People are starting toask about profitability.
- [Reid] Fancy that.
- Yeah, fancy that.
So we thought, maybe weshould seriously talk to them.
We start going down the path.
They wanna buy us for $88 million dollars.
We thought, I thought, youknow, this is pretty good.
We should sell the companybecause we need to beunder the aegis of a biggerplayer, and get the dedicateddistribution rights from brands.
Varsha agreed, but thenIdealabs stepped forwardand said, not sure about thisvaluation of $88 million.
We just told Goldman Sachsyou're worth $300 million.
And so I all of a sudden, Iguess as a very presumptuous28-year-old said, well ifyou don't like the price,then you should pay more.
And then that's what happened,so we sold it to Idealabfor over $100 million dollarsin cash in April, 2000,and two weeks later the Nasdaq plunged.
And I got my first gray hair,seriously, started gettinggray hair about that timebecause the merger had notbeen approved yet, and therewas all kinds of thingsthat happened during that process.
Needless to say, the deal stuck together.
We managed to hold the deal together.
I stayed on with theacquire, with Idealab.
We bunched a whole bunchof Idealab companiesinto Eve.com, and then finallywe resold it to Sephorain October, 2000.
So we sold it twice in about six months,something like that.
So that's part one.
That's the firstentrepreneurial experience.
- [Reid] And before wemove on, so one is ifyou were to call yourself,your current self sitting here,you were able to talk to youryounger self just starting-- Oh, I wish I could.
- Yeah.
What are the key thingsyou would tell yourselfabout how to run that race differently.
Like what to emphasizeand what to detract?- I would have tried to thinka little bit longer termbecause when the company,so Idealab ran into issueswhere it couldn't go out.
It was about to go public.
Goldman was trying to take them out.
Then the market fell apart,so they couldn't go public,so they wanted to shut us down.
And they said, Mariam, canyou resell the businessagain for us?So I turned around, pickedup the phone and called LVMH.
But in retrospect therewas something else Icould have done, which is takenthe money out of my pocketand bought it for atenth of what I had beenpaid essentially, andI could have bought thewhole thing back.
Two million uniques amonth in traffic alreadyafter one year.
- [Reid] Uh huh, yeah.
- But you know, when youare, I said to myself,when you're young andyou're going through likeall of a sudden the Great Depression,you have this tendencyto become conservative.
And when everything startsfalling apart around you,every single day there'sa company going under,and the entire world is imploding,it's hard to have the historical context.
And maybe if I had been abetter student of historyI would have realized that theinternet was indeed not over,(Reid and Miriam laugh)and it was not time toleave town, but you know,I would have bought it back myself.
That's what I would have done.
- [Reid] Yeah, but there wastwo years of winter, right?Maybe even three or four.
- [Mariam] Yeah.
- [Reid] So that would havebeen a very bold choice.
- It would have been a boldchoice, and I was severelyin debt when I graduatedfrom the business school.
I was able to pay off my debts.
Nobody in my family camefrom a business background,so for me this was like,the sale was a big triumph.
And so kind of put me in avery different place in life,so I had a hard timethinking, I'll put my cashback in again now.
So I did get a little conservative,and I've been fightingthat ever since.
- [Reid] So one thing youwould have done is sayas opposed to selling toSephora, actually in fact,a belief in the internetand the macro counterbeing contrarian, I wouldhave actually bought it backand built from it, becauseactually in fact the assetwas a unique asset, thatactually something they couldmake something out of.
- Totally, I would havetried to figure out,and now I know how to makebusinesses profitable,but I did not know forsure then how to do it,but I learned it afterwardsgoing to a bigger company.
I went to a biggercompany for a couple yearsto really learn how to run a P and L,and now realize I couldhave probably done it with,'cause we were already doingabout $10 million in saleson an annual run rate in their first year.
So it's a lot of what if's andcould have's, should have's,but I think the idea is to be a little bitless conservative.
I would have been alittle less conservative.
- [Reid] And what about other lessons?Like financing pattern, hiring patterns,go to market patterns?Anything of those?- [Mariam] Yes.
So one thing was I didn'tlike the size of the Boardbeing so large at the beginning,and all the Board members,some of them didn't get along that well.
So I spent about 25-- [Reid] That's probablycode for terribly, right?- No comment.
So there were Boardmembers who didn't agree.
There were two Boardmembers from the Series Bfighting over one Board seat all the time,trying to kind of gain favorswith us to try to give themthe Board seat.
Then we spent about 20 percent of our timemanaging the Board, whichI thought was wasted time.
I just thought, you know,I need to focus all my timeright now on building this company.
I worked 'til ten o'clockevery night in the office.
I mean, I don't have time tospare to manage the Board.
And getting someone apashmina scarf, etc.,it's a long story.
But it's a very long story.
So I thought, OK, smallBoard, maybe back away fromVC financing quite so early,and it was very much, you know,on the other hand I gotto see what a lot ofcapital buys you.
The best PR firm, the best executives,the best head hunters.
I could see, I learned onsomebody else's dime really,and that's what made itpossible to do Minted in acompletely different way, whichis I raised $11 million forseven years of operation, andthen brought it to break even,and for a commercecompany that makes things.
And so that was a very,very different capitaland financing strategy.
And I would not have, I don'tthink, been able to do that,had I...
and also actually known how to scale now'cause now we're going intothe big, we've raised thebig capital, raised $90million now for Minted,and we're definitely inthe range of hiring themore expensive executives and all of that.
And I wouldn't have seen howto do it had I not done itthe first time with Eve,so it's a little, you know.
- [Reid] I may come backand ask you a couple morequestions about Evebecause that is actually,you've literally tee'd upwhat was the next questionafter Eve.
Let's do that now, which is, you know,one of the key things thathas kind of been a themethroughout the quarter forthe students is choosingwhen to blitzscale.
It isn't like success equals blitzscale,failure equals not blitzscale.
- [Miriam] Um hmm.
- [Reid] You know, partof what we did in the verybeginning when we wereportraying LinkedIn iswe said, look, there wasthis very long period wherewe were just getting it rightbefore we actually did that.
And actually making thatdecision about when do youpour on the gas, and then how do you do itis actually one of the really key things.
- [Mariam] Yeah.
- [Reid] So let's talk alittle bit about kind of thefirst part of Minted,right, which is (mumbling)capital fish head, tryingto raise $7 million dollars,11 or whatever.
- [Mariam] Eleven, yes.
- [Reid] And go for sevenyears, go through that,and then now is the time,and this is the reason.
- [Miriam] Um hmm.
OK, well I thought that I hadsome lifestyle considerations,so in the beginning I hadjust had my second child,so I wanted to reallycontrol the pace myself.
So what Eve bought me wascredibility and being able tomake investors a return.
And with that I had a lotof choices, career choices,and I could afford a lotof support, for example.
I could have a family, I couldbasically have everything.
I could have my family and have a career,and that was really great.
So I think getting out ofthe gates early with thetaking of risks really paid off for me,and I would encourage peopleto think about that early.
So basically I guess withMinted, I wanted to basicallycontrol the pace.
I was worried about peoplegetting in the way ofthe strategy when the strategywasn't quite solidified.
So when I raised angelfinancing people weren't quitenecessarily on board withcrowdsourcing 100 percentamong our angels.
They were thinking crowdsourcingsounds interesting,but maybe crowdsourcingis nothing, you know.
Who knows that crowdsourcing is gonna do.
So sign up all these brands,go with the brand strategy.
It was a web 1.0 strategy ofbuilding distribution rightswith existing stationerybrands, believe it or not,that we did, in additionto trying to build thecrowdsourcing mechanism.
And so I wanted to have theflexibility to really changethe model quite dramaticallywithout having to take10 people with me around onthose strategic meanderings,so that was another thing.
- [Reid] Keep the team small for agility.
- Agility, and communicationis everything, right?So if you have to communicateto 10 Board membersversus one or two, it'sjust a completely differentproposition, and I reallybelieve in keeping peopleupdated along the way sothere are no surprises.
So I really try to bring people along.
Third, there wasn't a lot of competition.
Nobody was talking aboutcrowdsourcing really,and nobody was talking about stationery.
So I didn't really have to worry.
It wasn't the Eve.comsituation where we were in thislike land grab where theminute we launched four otherVC-backed companieslaunched behind us intothe cosmetics market.
There was, you guys probablydon't remember this,but there was Gloss.com, and I don't know,lots of companies whose namesI don't even remember now.
Five of us all launched, andwe were the first by a month,maybe a month and ahalf, and then there werefour behind us.
So that was an example oftrying to grab mind sharein consumers' minds asthis is the number onefirst destination for cosmeticsonline, and spending moneyto make sure everybody knew that, right?Minted, it was like noone was circling at all,so I could take my time.
So I had the luxury of no competition.
So those were some of the decisions.
When we finally started,I think your question is,well what then made us finally do it?- [Reid] Yep.
- [Mariam] Well, we always imagined-- [Reid] Actually, talk alittle bit about also your ideafor starting it becauseas a formerly successfulentrepreneur, you're notgonna start somethingunless you think it can be big.
- [Mariam] Yeah.
- [Reid] You know, in thatbig thing you think, OK,we're gonna go run tight for a while,but I do plan to get big.
So it wasn't like no, no, no.
Yes, there is like look, I'dlike to have some controlover my life, but if it just gonna be,like if it had been alifestyle business for you,you have been like, no, no thanks,-- [Mariam] Right.
I'm trying to do something.
So what was the thinkingabout, oh, this one actuallyin fact, will have thatkind of lengthy ramp?Was there certain hypothesesyou wanted to test?- Yeah.
Well, so I've been a lifelong shopper.
I'll admit it right now.
When I wasn't doing my homework at school,I was always in the mall.
My parents would alwayscriticize me for it.
And then I would go thereand think, geez you know,first this brand is hot,then this brand is not.
And I actually really, forexample, respect Mickey Drexlerat Gap as being, wellhe used to be at Gap,now J. Crew, as this greatmerchant, but even he can havea bad couple of years.
So what I really wantedto do was figure out a wayto build a retail brandthat would last forever,that would be fresh forever.
And the way I thought youcould do that is by completelyremoving the risk associatedwith a couple peoplechoosing the merchandise,because what if thosecouple people are wrong, andwhat if they have a bad year?So the hypothesis was, andI'm still completely obsessedwith this hypothesis 'causeI'm trying to see how farI can take it, is if you turnall the decisions over tothe crowd, and you letpeople submit and curate,you will be potentially fresh forever.
And it was a completehypothesis, and I thought I wouldstart in stationery, which Peter Fenton,one of our backers now says Ibought a gun to a knife fightbecause we figured out how todo crowdsourcing of design,and we brought it tothe stationery business,so a broader market.
And the stationery market isa $10 billion dollar market.
It's not that large, but I didit because I wanted to startin a small place where I couldhave very little competition,really revolutionize design completely,and then I loved the unit economics.
High average transactionvalue, high marginsinherent virality of theproduct, which we can talk aboutin the market thing, inherentvirality, huge repeat factor,great customers that repeatwith you, if you're loyal.
So once you get them, youcan sell them other things,they repeat with you,you've built something.
So I started there, but thenwith this hypothesis thatwe would build just astationery retailer that wascrowdsourced and see ifwe could do something bigwith that market, but thenin 2011-12 realized thatwe weren't a stationery retailer at all.
We had built a community ofindependent creatives whowere not stationery designers at all.
And I can talk more about that,but that's when I realizedwe would take the capital,and that's when the scalingof the capital started.
- [Reid] Got it, and thetheory of the scale capitalto scale the business was...
- It is that we could nolonger do the cheap thingof having a couple of usdo all the executive jobsif we really wanted to growourselves into a severalhundred million, severalbillion dollar companyand address different markets.
- [Reid] So you wereadvancing the burn rate.
Were you advancing the burn rate onbuilding the organization?Were you advancing theburn rate on recruitinga bunch of new peoplewithin the design community?- I see.
It was all people inside the company.
We're a very product driven company.
We spend very little onmarketing, and so it was allbuilding engineering,building an executive team outto run the different groups,different departments.
I was basically before that,basically playing maybefour or five VP roles myself.
Same with my co-founder, who I recruitedright out of Stanford.
So I recruited a co-founderwho was about seven to 10 yearsyounger than me, right out of the GSB,and we each split all the VProles up in the beginning.
That's how we got to cashflow break even in 2012,basically 'cause we didn't hire a lot ofexpensive executives.
But then we realized thatthat wasn't gonna scale toa larger business, or to more vertical.
So we went from stationery into art.
We sell wall art now, wall art prints.
We started in 2012.
We launched fabrics by the yard last year,and this year we moved into home decor.
So we now sell home decorlike pillows, lamp shades,etc., etc., made on demandfor you out of all thesecrowdsourced designs.
So we moved progressivelyinto more and more verticals.
- And so let's think alittle bit about that move.
Let's expose a little bitabout the move in vertical'cause that's part of...
Like there's two partsof the scaling piecesthat you exemplify.
One part of it is, OK,how do we really build upthe employees in orderto capture a much largermarket opportunity, andto do that at some speedin order to occupy the critical mass, etc.
- [Mariam] Right.
- Second part of it is let'salso deploy like some timedit software developerson like an iOS platformor something else, butlet's deploy a communityto also add a lot valueinto the ecosystem.
- [Mariam] Yep.
- So when you're making a decision to go,you know, like OK, so we were stationery.
Oh, and in case you guysmissed it, the word that isobviously way overused inSilicon Valley, but is disrupt,right, sort of disruptingthe stationery business.
And also it's kind of theclassic zero-to-one thesis oflike, OK, let's tacklesomething that we know we can,we don't know, we have avery good bet of killing.
And then once we havethat, then we can actually,in fact, round up.
- [Mariam] Yep.
- How did your thinkinggo to, now is the time,these are the verticals,we're gonna do it as amultiple vertical strategy?And how did that allplay in the community?- Right, so we did what wethought were small experiments.
Everything at Minted is a competition.
You run competitions, peopleenter the competitionsfrom all over the world.
There are no qualifications needed.
All you do is upload a .jpeg, that's it.
And then if you win, yougive us the original file,we sell it, you make a great commission,and everyone is happy.
And a up-front cash prizethat you get to keep.
And people vote, andeveryone is invited to vote.
When we decided to moveinto art, we decided to justtry one art challenge.
And I decided to takethe furthest away thing,the most challengingthing I could possibly dojust to kind of see, canthe community produce artthat people want to put on their walls?Because that's verydifferent from producinga piece of stationery.
However, the supplychain is about the same.
I can use the same supplychain, 'cause I didn't mentionto you that we make everything, too.
So once we source the file,we have all these integratedpartnerships, and we sendout files to the printers,and the printers drop ship.
So I could leverage the samesupply chain back end, right?But go very far to seehow far we could stretchthe community, the same community.
It worked.
Within three months wehad West Elm calling us,a retailer owned byWilliams Sonoma, to say,we want your art in all of our stores.
That was the first sign it wasworking, was when the peoplein the know start calling you and saying,we need this content.
'Cause ultimately Mintedis a content destination.
- [Reid] Yes.
- We make content.
We just happen tomonetize it by selling itin physical form to you.
We're gonna sell it indigital form starting,about a week from now we're gonna launchdigital invitations, so youknow, we'll be competing withPaperless Post and Evite in about a week.
- [Reid] Is that OK to be on video camera,or is that confidential?- Yeah, it's fine.
- [Reid] Or we could delaythe release of this video.
- Yeah, sure, sure, yeah.
- [Reid] OK.
- [Voiceover] It'll be delayedby about a week anyway.
- Perfect, so that's about-- [Reid] So don't tweet that.
- Yeah, so we're agnosticactually about whether wemonetize the content eitherphysically or digitally.
We don't really care in the end.
It's like whatever you wannado to create, bring styleand design to your life is great with us.
But the point is thatwe went far, it worked.
We started getting, and theindicators, when you're verysmall scale, you haveno traffic, for example,trying to decide whethersomething is working ornot working in a consumerbusiness can be very challenging.
So I didn't tell you thatwe almost folded the companyin the first month of ourexistence 'cause there wereno sales whatsoever for thefirst month and then it's a-- [Reid] Actually, I didn't know that.
Let's go into that a little bit.
- You wanna?- [Reid] Yes, please.
- OK, so the first month welaunched we had zero sales.
Very different from Eve.comwhere immediately peoplestarted streaming in buyingmakeup from us in kind ofa surprising fashion.
No sales, not a single one.
Maybe week number six we hadone sale, one transaction.
And what the transactionwas, was nobody was buyingany of the branded stationeryproducts that we had spentprobably 90 percent of ourfunding launching becauseour investors thought thatwould be a little safer,which I understand.
And there were 22 designsthat were crowdsourced for"save the date" card invitations.
I don't know if you guyseven know what those are,but those are wedding, likeyou send out a save the daycard out when you getengaged, and you're aboutto get married.
So that, 22 of those designs,they started selling.
So there's this tinysign of life in this tinylittle corner.
One transaction a week.
Then there were two.
And maybe two anotherweek, and then three.
And the question was, theproblem is we had no traffic,so we had no ability to tellwhether that was good or badexcept the conversion ratewas point one percent,which is pretty lousy, of unique visitors,transactions divided byunique visitors, right?So you wanna get a conversionrate at least up toone percent or higherreally, to be a healthycommerce business.
So I thought to myself, geez,maybe I should just takeall the money and giveit back to my friends.
They were all my friendswho angel invested.
I'm feeling very responsible.
I can't take two and a halfmillion from my friends,and burn it.
And honestly, the reason I kept going,just completely honestly,was I did not wannalose my friends' money.
I felt so responsible fortaking my friends' money thatI just could not lose their money.
- [Reid] Yeah, I'm gonna make this work.
- I'm gonna make it work,I don't care what happens,I gotta make it work.
And that means I'm gonnatake a venture round,so that's why I took the venture round.
(laughter)So I took the venture roundin 2008, the first round,right a couple weeks before Lehman failed.
(laughter)- [Reid] You have somegood timing, by the way.
- Do not watch me carefully.
Do not watch me, yeah, I don'twanna be watched about this.
But yes, in this particularcase one of my angels calledand said, "I have a really bad feeling."This is August, 2008.
"I have a really bad feeling.
"I really think youshould raise some money"to save the company."I said, "I think you're right, Alex."This is my friend, AlexSlusky, he runs Vector.
And I quit my vacation,flew down from where I wasin Seattle, and thenraised money from IDG.
And then literally I wassaying to the lawyers,"I got a bad feeling, we gotta close this,"we gotta close it."And then two weeks later.
- [Reid] By the way, justso you don't feel likeyou're completely unique in this,-- [Mariam] Yes.
two parts of my ownpersonal history in this.
So PayPal raised a hundredmillion dollars on a500 prix with no revenuein 2000, and we closedthe day that Nasdaq peaked.
- [Miriam] Oh no.
- Right, right.
- [Mariam] That's fantastic.
- And this was Peter'sgenius, not mine, Peter Teal.
Because Peter, there was somuch interest that there was,there were someinternational folks who werededucing our bank, becausethis was the crazy,you remember the first oomph.
They were deducing ourbank account, wiring us$10 million dollars, and thentelling us because we hadthe money already we hadto let them into the round.
- [Mariam] Wow.
(laughter)- That's how crazy it was, right?And you're like, what?You wired us money from overseas,and you think (mumbling).
Now I was amongst everyoneelse in telling Peter that,well, shoot, if we havethat much interest,we should just, you know,like raise more moneyand raise a round.
And Peter was like, no.
This is crazy.
This is a sign thateverything is totally insane.
We're closing, we're closing,we're closing, we're closing.
And so, you know, likethat is, you can't get thatreal perfect timing, there's luck in that.
But oh my gosh, that was the, you know,-- [Mariam] Yeah, scary.
that was the beginning.
The other one is also 2008.
Early in 2008 David Szeat Greylock, you know,came to me, was on my Boardat LinkedIn, and said,"My partners and I have been talking."This was one of the actuallyfunctions and valuesof a venture firm, and say, "Wethink the market's unstable.
"We don't really know whatit is, what's gonna go on."They didn't say, oh, wepredict it's a failureand credit people swaps, right?But they're like, "Things are overheated.
"You should seriously considerdoing a round as insurance."And we raised a roundentirely on an insurance basisin 2008 ourselves, our series D for again.
- [Mariam] Um hmm, that's great.
- Very, very similar kind of story.
And by the way, that'spart of one of the generalscale up strategies, sometimesassociated with blitzscaling,otherewise is to actually do that kind ofcapital planning, right?Because you might say, look,I may not absolutely needthis money right now, butI may need it intensely.
And so like now is a good time to get it.
- [Mariam] Right.
And it always takes youmore money and more timethan you thought to doa lot of things, right,so your plans.
So yes, so we almostclosed the company down,but we managed it.
I just stuck with it justsort of sheer commitmentto my friends.
- So did the idea for doingthe crowd network comeas an experiment in the beginning?Or is that what you wantedto do, and your investorspersuaded you to do the branding thing?- I really wanted to go docompletely crowdsourcing,but I made the decisionmyself to be balanced becauseI was being counseledto, let's be careful.
And I willingly made the decision myself.
I'm so glad that we did itthough, because it savedthe company, and we thenhad to go jettison all thebrand relationships we had built.
So we had signed up allthese brands for exclusivedistribution, and then hadto have the courage to goface all of them and say,oops, sorry, we made a mistake.
We can't sell any of yourproducts, it turns out, at all,and instead we're going to gocompletely compete with youand source all these crowdsourced designs.
And not only that, but thereason why all these peopleare entering in the competitionsto begin with is becauseyou are here with us right now.
- [Reid] Thanks for that.
- And it was terrible, I feltreally terrible about it.
And so that's what created thisaspiration for all of thesewanna be designers tocome in because we hadall these fantastic brands signed up.
in the beginning.
- [Reid] Right.
'Cause it took the brandthing for people to say-- [Mariam] This is a good plan.
competing in this competition-- [Mariam] is worth something.
is worth something.
- [Mariam] Exactly.
- Is there a different wayyou would hack that nowif you were to call your younger self?Would you, with all theregrets and everything else,play the same path, orwould you do it differently?- I would feel ethicallyhave a hard time doing it,knowing what happened.
I wouldn't have planned it that way,and I would have a hardtime doing that now.
But I think there are waysyou can hack around that.
But the key thing is you need to buildaspiration for people.
- [Reid] Yep.
- And there are otherways to build aspiration.
So with the community, youhad asked me a question thoughabout scaling.
It turns out that we have not had to do,we've to make smart andvery consistent and fairpolicies to our community.
We don't change them,we don't go back on ourcommunity members ever.
We have very, very strictpolicies about not going backon people, communication isvery consistent and clear,those kinds of things.
But we've not had to investmoney in the community.
And so in the artbusiness, just an example,we didn't add anybody to our business fortwo and a half years, in the art business.
We just let the communitybuild up over timeand create all the content.
And then slowly as thecontent grew, conversion rateswent up, and the businessgrew to basically aeight figure businessin two and half years,with absolutely hiringnobody at the company at all.
So community can be a greatleverage point if you canlet people make decisionsoutside the company,if you can build a communityand transfer entire functionsessentially to the community.
Our whole product designarm is really our communityof people who don't work for us directly.
Well, you know so much about that.
That can be a huge,it's a huge level point.
I mean, we just launched,if you go to our site,and you go to the Participate section,one week ago we launchedan outdoor art challenge,so we are decorating...
Because our landlord inSan Francisco asked us,he loves what we did onthe inside of the building,so he's asked us to decoratethe outside of the building.
So we now have a challengegoing right now to decoratethe outside of 747 Front.
So it's really quite amazingwhat a community will doif you manage it with thecore consistent practices.
- [Reid] Are you familiar with Hayek?- [Mariam] No, Hayek?- [Reid] Hayek, he's a Austrian economistwho won the Nobel Prize.
- [Mariam] Oh, Hyack, oh yeah, OK, sorry.
- [Reid] Yes, yes.
Did you deliberatelydesign the community rulesand that kind of a ruleof lay Hayek-ian fashion?- Hmmm, no.
But I think of it as a society,a separate society which hasdemonstrated a lot ofcharacteristics of an actualreal live civilization in the real world.
For example, people areconstantly striving to climbladders in our society,in our Minted society.
They're never happy being at a rung.
They're always looking for the next rung.
It's very, very interesting.
People don't want it to be flat at all.
They don't want acommunism in our society.
They want this hierarchy.
There are all kinds ofinteresting things thatwe've observed in our community.
- [Reid] Well, this is partof how your community isactually different thanMozilla and Code For America,which is part of last week, right?- Oh, OK, interesting.
- And so you actually havethe commercial communityas a representative.
What did you learn about the building ofthat community network?Such that you would go,oh, I doubled down on that.
That was something thatwas really important.
Someone else trying to builda community like this issomething you should think about.
And also those arepositive lessons, and thennegative lessons like, oh, ifI could call myself earlierI'd say, don't do that one,or do it less or differently.
- The positive lessons havebeen to go really slowly.
I mean, there's no rushto change policies.
For example, we started veryconservatively with commissionsbecause we figured looking ateBay and some of the thingsthat happened at eBaywhen they tried to bringcommissions down, wethought well, there's onlyone way to go, which is up.
You don't wanna reducecommissions on people,so let's start veryconservatively, and then move upslowly over time.
So that's served us well.
Consistently trying toemphasize fairness and goodtreatment of people hasbeen enormous for us 'causethe word of mouth amongdesigners has been very strong.
One thing I noticed early wasI read that book Blink by,I'm sorry, sorry, I'm gettingthis completely wrong.
I'm sorry, no, no, I apologize.
There's a book by Daniel Pink called...
- [Voiceover] Drive?- Drive, thank you.
Sorry, Drive.
And it talks about how moneycan sap the true energy ofa community and of a society,the discussion around money.
And I made an early mistakewhere having looked atMary Kay and Avon I thought, OK,commissions have just come in.
So and so has made this much money.
Why don't we do what MaryKay and Avon do and celebratethe person who made themost money at the end ofthe holiday quarter, and writea letter to the communityand say, so and so made this much money.
Isn't that great, celebration.
'Cause you know, at theconferences in direct salesthey'll get the top seller upon the stage and celebrate,and there'll be a pink Cadillac, and etc.
We had a very negative reaction-- [Reid] Second prize issteak knives, but yes.
- Steak knives.
- Sorry, Glengarry Glen Ross.
It's a movie, it's theclassic sales movie.
First prize, Cadillac,second prize, steak knives,third prize, you're fired.
- OK, I have to watch that again.
So we did that.
We had a huge negative reaction.
People started quittingthe community after we sentthat email out.
They started stop participating.
I can never be as good as that person.
I'm never gonna earn that much money.
We had all kinds of interestingreactions, and especiallypeople focused more onmoney than on anything else.
When we moved it away topersonal growth, to learning,'cause people communicatewith each other and critiqueeach other, and that's a keyprinciple of what we provide,is education and learning, wemoved it into a better place.
So we looked at all theincentives, and we don't reallytalk about money very often.
We don't say, you'regonna quit your day job,because what an expectationto build that you can'tever live up to, you know.
So we talk about things thatwe know we can live up to.
You will get great critique and educationfrom this community.
Your brand will be built by us.
You will have fun, and we'llplay a game that's really fun.
This is a fun game to play.
There'll be a fun reward, set of rewards.
You'll make friends,those kinds of things,and we talk about money way last.
And that was one mistake Imade early that I thoughtwas kind of interesting learning.
- [Reid] Yeah, especiallygiven the commercial community.
Now how do you reconcilethe whole hierarchyof community that youwere at earlier pointtogether with this no, Idon't want the pink Cadillacgrand prize sort of thing, whereI'm measuring myself there?How does that play?- I think people, they wantto know that they are justmaking progress in life.
So I'm not sure, I thinkthe progress can comein many forms.
It could be you're going toinclude me in the catalog,or in some marketing vehicle,as easily as it could beI've earned my way into ahigher level of commission.
So I think that you canbuild hierarchy even franklygetting a phone call, believeit or not, with the Mintedteam is seen as a treasurebecause you might get someinteresting insidercritique on your work thatyou really want.
So there is all sorts ofother incentives that you canprovide other than directlymoney that can createa sense of progress,continued forward progress.
The human wants to makecontinued forward progress,it turns out, which is a great thing.
So nobody is satisfieddoing the same thingagain and again, I think.
- [Reid] And before we getback to the scale thing,there's one other kind of technical thing.
Do you ever recurse at all?Do you ever have the Mintedcommunity create thingsthat are essentially thestatus markers or the progressmarkers that you then handout to the Minted communityas part of what you're doing?- Hmm, interesting.
We do have positive commentsthat we allow the communityto give to each other thatresult in certain awards.
For example, the most helpful.
The most helpful, themost helpful commentorin the community, forexample, is elected by thecommunity members.
And then that personreceives other rewards.
So we're starting to have,we're starting to have.
We don't have that fully built out.
- [Reid] So you have somestuff whereby people are sayingin these kinds of things it's completelycommunity controlled.
Is the recognition alsoan artifact designed bythe Minted community?- It is not, but it probably should be.
Yeah, we need to takemore and push it out.
I just wanna keeppushing stuff completely,decisions more and moreout to the community.
But all the policing, forexample, happens in the community.
We don't pay any money toanyone to police bad behaviorbecause the communitycontinuously reports onbad behavior to us.
- [Reid] So they report.
Do they act, or do you act?- Sometimes they takematters into their own hands,and it's vigilante justice.
They'll leave commentsto each other that arenot that great, but they tryto be, overall it's a prettypolite community, and supportive.
So they oftentimes would prefer we do it.
- [Reid] It's more likeneighborhood watch.
- Neighborhood watch.
Not complete vigilanteism, yes.
- So now get to scaling the community.
This is fantastic it worked out this way.
Did it just grow on its own,or were there anything thatyou actually specifically hadto do in order to grow it?And was there anything youdid to try to acceleratethat growth or otherwisekind of fill out toget to critical mass?- So we did go to a tradeshow at one point in thevery early days, and we didmail the mailing list ofthe trade show.
So we did do that.
I think we did it once, maybe twice.
And then we thought,geez, we have way too manyentrants into these competitions.
We're gonna have to startturning too many people awaybecause ours is a curated marketplace.
We are curated.
Not everybody gets to sell on Minted.
It's only what gets voted in.
So we stopped recruitingbecause we thought we wereturning away too many people.
The other kind of surprisewas consumer marketing.
So in our attempt to buildan aspirational brandfor consumers we endedup attracting in a lotof designers actually.
So the surprise was how manyartists we actually attractbecause of our consumer marketing.
And making that reallyattractive essentially brought inpeople who are very design savvy.
And then the other thingI want to say that who isa creative in the U.S.,really globally right nowis completely changing.
So that was a surprise.
I thought that there would betrained stationery designersentering our competitions.
Actually it turns out thatthere were people approaching usat meetups and saying, Ihave a confession to make.
I've never been formally trained.
I taught myself how todesign in Microsoft Word.
Or I'm a plumber.
I met a plumber last week in New York,and she's one of the threefemale master plumbersin New York City.
Her grandfather was a plumber,her father's a plumber,she is a plumber, and sheenters Minted competitions,and she wins, and she beatspeople who have art degreesfrom really nice universities.
So what's happening rightnow is a tip of an icebergas to all the creative talentthat is hidden everywhereright now in this society,either because people were toldnot to pursue creative careers,they didn't have the moneyto get an education, or the tools.
That's changing nowbecause of visual, socialmedia platforms, aswell as access to tools.
And people are now expressing themselves,and so that who is a creativeand what the creativeeconomy is gonna be is gonnabe completely different.
- [Reid] Yeah, creativeculture and class andall these things.
- Yeah, hobbies.
- and the meritocracythat comes from a network.
It's great stuff.
But literally actually infact, on the growth side of ityou just, you hit the oil well.
- Yep.
- And the oil well goes.
- Yes, we never really hadto do anything after thatbecause the designerswould tell each other,you've really gotta submit to Minted.
So there was a word of mouthnetwork that started happening,and that we were good to work with.
And on the other hand theconsumer marketing startedattracting a lot of designers in.
And then we never reallyhad to recruit again.
When we went into art, theone exception I will makeis with art we did approacha few artists in the very,very early days to submit.
And we did a little bit ofwork recruiting maybe somethinglike 30 to 50 people.
Once the West Elm dealkicked in, and West Elm waspromoting Minted art-- [Reid] Yeah, 'causeyou're bringing the buyers,you're bringing alreadypeople who are curating this,and so people who areproducing it want to getinto those channels.
- And we brought morecredibility 'cause West Elmwas seen as credible, soall of a sudden it wasmore of the same thingthat started the community,which was credibilitythat builds an aspirationthat builds more community.
- [Reid] Alright, solet's shift to scalingthe organization.
- [Mariam] Um hmm.
- So now you've raisedmore substantial thing.
You say, OK, I actually infact have to raise executives,and pay them, and allthe rest of the stuff.
What have been the keylessons for now thatyou're scaling Minted?And it's different thanscaling Eve, where Eve was likeclassic internet boom.
Oh my gosh, there are competitorsthat are exactly like me,just a little bit behind me.
I need to out executethem, out spend them.
I just need to go like the dickens.
Here I can build out alittle bit more deliberately,but I am building to try toachieve a higher growth scale.
What are the things that have worked?What are the things thatyou're thinking about?What are the things you're trying?- Well, one of the mostfascinating things isif you're just around long enough,you start to realizethat you can grow peoplewithin the company, but youneed years and years to do that,to grow people into leaders.
And then you realize, it feelslike it was a smart strategy,but all you had to do waslike be around long enoughbecause essentially ifyou can look for people'sunique talents, and thengrow people from within,those people will become,I think, I believe now,the strongest leaders you have.
Some of them will.
We have tried to combine,have a portfolio strategy.
So we take disciplineswhere we are not experts,like finance, HR, wherepeople do things betterthan we do, and we hirethose people from outside.
The things that we dothat are differentiated,and where our secretsauce lies, for example,crowdsourcing instead oftraditional merchandising,we grow people from theinside because it's very hardto take let's say, amerchant from let's say Gap,and say, we want you to unlearneverything you've learnedfor the past 25 years, andnot believe in it anymore.
We're gonna completely break you downand build you back up again.
So that is a lot harderthan to take a person,let's say a very smartperson, build them up insidethe company, and build them into a leader.
So we've done that with our GM of Art,our GM of Stationery are both,general managers are bothgrown within the company.
And we've hired theChief People Office andthe VP of Finance from outsidethe company, for example.
- [Reid] And what are theways that you try to helpthem scale as executives?What are the techniques forthat 'cause that's actuallypart of the whole scale upchallenge when you're doingthat particular approach.
- It is really hard.
If you have no, in thebeginning one of the worst partswas that capital effectsculture, in that with very littlecapital you end up havingbasically no bench.
So if you have no bench, youcan't hold people accountable,and you basically...
It's hard to let people failwhen your bottom line isyou're so close to the bottom line.
So essentially if youhave very little capital,and you can't make anymistakes, it's very hard tolet people fail and grow on their own.
With more capital you canactually let some of thosemistakes happen, and your cashwon't go to zero, basically.
But we for seven years wereon this verge constantlyof running out of cash, for seven years.
And that was a very toughplace to be to let peoplemake mistakes, so I thought-- [Reid] Few more gray hairs?- What's that?- [Reid] Few more gray hairs?- Few more, definitely.
So I thought of it as a timewhere we were doing too muchmicro management and notenough open, sort of likelet people make mistakes,let people grow, etc.
Now what we can do is letpeople grow, make mistakes.
That's much more possible now.
We also hire advisors from theoutside using usually equityto bring in some experiencedpeople to help advisesaid grown from within executives.
So we do have somebody whois very senior from retailright now who is in advising the two GM's,providing anotheralternate opinion to mine.
- That's a classic actuallypattern for the Silicon Valleyscale up because it's like,OK, how do we use a networkto identify the key peopleto help grow the peoplewithin the team in order to get to that.
Because classically if you'redoing a disruptive business,they'll recruit someonewho is an expert in retail.
They're not expert this,they're expert at that game.
The whole reason this game'sworking is it's a new game.
It's a different game.
- Right, exactly.
- Different success metrics.
So how do you get theadvice in order how to learnthe skills that are criticalin building up (mumbling)That's a canonical patternthat's actually very good.
- Good, I'm glad we'redoing the right thing.
I'm trying to think of otherways we've helped people scale.
We try to do peer feedback,so we have gone throughcoaching to allow each other,basically encourage peopleto hold each other accountable.
So I don't know if you guyshave read the Five Dysfunctionsbook by Lencioni, but we'veall read that together.
We went to a coaching session together,and we've tried tobasically have peers holdpeers accountable, which isone of the hardest thing to doin an environment whereeveryone's very collaborative,and they all wanna maintainvery good relationshipswith each other.
- [Reid] When did you start that?- We just started that thebeginning of this year,and we hit, so we're about150 people at the beginningof this year.
And we had finallyhired the executive teamafter many years.
And went on, hired a coach.
- [Reid] Yep, so this is allpart of the scale up plan.
- This is definitely, yeah,trying to get people to bond,have a sense of a first team,meaning first team principalsis your peer group at the executive level.
And then being able tohold people accountable,each other.
So the CEO should no longerbe really the only onedelivering all the bad news,and that instead of holdingpeople accountable, theidea is that the team canhelp manage each other, alright.
So that's another thing.
- [Reid] Well, that'skinda classic scale plans,also part of the key thingthat I think all scale upsneed to do is culture,right, which is how do yousalvage a culture thatwill actually preserveas you're going is actuallyin fact really key,and so it's like, OK,let's do that as well.
So let's shift a little bit to your role,and how your role started and changed.
Obviously, seven yearsof staying very close to,above the, just profitableenough means that tremendousseeing the details on everythingin order to make it work,and every fire is a firethat lands on your desk.
- [Mariam] Yep.
- So at the beginninghow did you triage fires?'Cause there's too many,so how did you kinda go,alright, these ones I let burn.
These ones I deal with.
And are there any particularlyinteresting examples?- Yeah, in the beginning I kneweverything about everything,everything that wasgoing on at the company,and I think one of thebiggest adjustments now isbeing OK actually not knowingeverything that's going onat your company.
It's a very weird disconcertingfeeling for somebodywho's very detail oriented.
In terms of triaging in thebeginning, it was all aboutrevenue growth, revenuegrowth, and revenue growth.
It was very revenue orientedbecause we had no cash, right?So it was very quantitativelybased in terms ofwe'd rank our initiatives,figure out what would driverevenue growth, and go down the list.
I mean, it was very like focused on that.
- [Reid] Uh huh, yeah.
- Whilst not damaging the brand.
- And by the way, justfor the class basis,part of the whole scale upthing is you have to be,the fundamental strategylayer is managing capital.
So you either have to behaving a financing plan,and some companies dothis through a successiveset of financings, and they'replanning what their nextfinancing is going as they're doing it.
Or you have to be managing with cash,but if you're not managingthe financial strategyas fundamental, you can'tget to product strategy,you can't get to productdistribution strategy, etc.
- Right, yeah.
So in the early days my rolewas very much about capital.
Acquiring capital, makingsure the product was workingvery well, and hiring basically.
And I was trying to thinkabout this over the weekend,which is, has anything changed?I'm still thinking about capital.
I'm still thinking about product.
I'm still thinking aboutstrategy, about hiring.
And I would say I've justlayered more things on franklyas the company's gotten more complex.
- [Reid] Have you changed theway you're thinking about?- Yes, so now for example, inthe beginning I was very muchinvolved with our go tomarket monetization strategy,which is how to get sales going.
I was super involved in marketing.
Within two to three yearsI was no longer involvedin marketing, and I am verynot involved in marketingright now, for example.
I'm more involved on theproduct side on strategy.
You know, we growth companies get hungry,and we're looking forconstant areas of growth.
We're hungry companies.
And so what happens isyou basically get yourproduct strategy, youdo product market fit,you've got your revenuescaling, you figure out how toget your revenue to continuegoing without you doing it,and then you make your lifemore complicated becauseyou might look for growth avenues.
And that could be either goingto different geographies.
You could be going, for usinto different verticals.
So we made our lives morecomplicated looking formore addressable marketsize to attract capital,to attract people, andbasically to fulfill our missionof making everything in theworld really well designed,'cause we really think thateverything in our customers'lives can be more beautifuland better designed over time.
But to answer your question,the role has changed becauseI basically try, there aremany, many areas that I do notmanage directly at all.
We set objectives, we manage by numbers,and I look at the numbers,and basically it's by creatingvery, very succinct andrepetitive dashboards franklythat we look at every Monday,you can tell when somethingis going wrong or not.
And if something is going wrong,then you can go dive deep.
- [Reid] You strike meas a numbers person.
You probably created thosedashboards earlier thanmost entrepreneurs.
- [Mariam] Yeah, myself.
Well because the thingwith Eve.com way back whenwas that there was nobodyto make dashboards,so you had to sit therewith a blank piece of paperand think, now what metricsshould I invent to managean e-commerce business?Like you had to do everythingcompletely from scratch,yourself, on a blank sheet.
So I got really into managingand building dashboardsand metrics.
It's one of my absolutefavorite things to do.
I know it sounds crazy, butI love building dashboards,like metrics.
And I find now it's away of teaching people.
So now I think about theanalytics of the companyas a key way of leveragingmyself and creating reportsfor other people, to transferknowledge to other peoplewho are burgeoning GMs.
- [Reid] So you're naturallythat way, but that is actuallyone of the also classic kindof blitzscaling techniques isyou have to actually beginto start putting metrics anddashboards at the centerof your management chainand your cross communicationand collaboration chain.
- [Mariam] Yes.
- [Reid] And there's dangersto that, too, alright,because if you have the wrong dashboard,or too many things, or there'smetrics that people aretracking that are not actually in fact thestrategic metrics, that canactually create dysfunctionas well as function.
- [Mariam] Yeah.
- [Reid] Any particularhistorical back looks atgreat function and dysfunctionthrough the creation of-- Well, the key thing isto create really consistentquestions from the very beginning,and do not change thosequestions over time 'causeyou need the every yearhistory, and you need thatrecord to be sacrosanct.
Like do not touch thehistory, and do not changethe questions over years.
So for example, we havebeen tracking our NPS scoreand asking the same exactquestions since July of 2008.
- [Reid] And just in case,-- [Mariam] Sorry.
I expect everyone knows what NPS score is,but just in case, Net Promoter Score.
It's basically will yourcustomers refer your productor service to otherpeople, and it's a way,it basically when business school profs,I think it came out of Wharton,but I don't know which groupit actually came out of, butwhen they did an analysisabout how you analyze how ultimately happyyour customers are with you,a lot of them all correlatedwith your NPS score,so makes it much simplerin order to do something.
- Yeah, exactly.
And so we put into place...
The things that I have notlet go of, I'm gonna circleback to analytics, are analytics,reading customer feedbackand talking to customers directly,getting primary informationversus secondary information,brand, community, strategy.
- [Reid] You said you'renot doing much in marketing,but you just said you'reholding on to brand.
- Brand expression, butnot acquisition strategy,traffic generation, drivingrevenue, but actuallywhat's the brand expression?Creative expression of the brand.
But not operations anymore.
I used to run customer service.
I do not do that anymore.
- [Reid] By the way, themost hard core one of that,have you ever met PaulEnglish who did Kayak,he's out in Boston?- [Mariam] No.
- [Reid] He put his cell number as thecustomer service number.
- [Mariam] Oh my god, wow.
That's bold.
- That was the hardestcore one of that ever.
- Yeah, yeah.
So we are very customer-centric,customer service oriented,but I would manage a lot ofshifts and basically managecustomer service for acouple of years during theholiday season, which Iwould not wish on anybody.
It was a great learningexperience, but glad it'snot me anymore.
But the key thing with analytics-- [Reid] Usually on learning experiences,that's usually the dot dotdot, glad it's not me anymore.
- Yeah, it's fantastic becausethere's nothing that cansubstitute having thatexperience, I think.
But for us at least, we built key metricsearly and did not changethem, and were rigorous abouttracking them at a regularpace every Monday morning.
Every Monday we produce our dashboards.
They're rigorous, they go out regularly.
It's a process that people follow.
- [Reid] Do you have a staffsit down with the numbers?- We do, we have a salesmeeting every Monday.
And on the research side webelieve both in the sort ofqualitative talk to thecustomers to interpret thingsyou can't get through thenumbers, and then takethose hypotheses that come out of that,and then test them throughlarge scale, like Survey Monkey.
Survey Monkey, I have builtso much of our businessusing Survey Monkey.
I could go on forever about Survey Monkey.
- Selena will be herein a couple of weeks.
- OK, well we have reallysignificantly impactedour business by usingSurvey Monkey to intuitnew products, to figure out what people,I mean, you wouldn'tbelieve how much we builtout of it.
- [Reid] Anything in howyou developed the initialkind of stationery contestsand everything else thatyou would change when you look back?Add, subtract?- There's probably a ton ofthings I would have liked tohave engineering capacity tobuild, and I probably reallyunderfunded the business frankly.
I probably was a littleconservative honestly.
I think it was a little bitthough influenced by wanting tonot get diluted ownership-wise,and then also worried aboutjust the outcome.
You know, was I going toget forced down the path oftaking the company public?Or what was gonna happen?I wanted to have control over the outcome,at least a little bit of control.
But I did underfund thecompany, and I probablyshould have used engineeringtime to build more featuresinto the game earlier.
- [Reid] Yep.
- So I would have done thata little bit earlier, yeah.
- [Reid] So I'm gonnaask two of the questionsthat were submitted.
Gives you a sense ofhow many more questions.
I have a stack of questionsI haven't gotten to,but I'm gonna also open it upto questions from the audiencein case you guys have specificsthat are coming out here.
And if not, that's fine, I'vegot plenty to go through.
You know, one of the thingsthat's from Andre Piyonkoff,I'm really terrible with names.
Actually I used to alwaysannounce my super power isI'm terrible at pronouncingnames in the written form.
What are some of the importantcharacteristics of theindependent artist communitywhich enabled buildinga successful marketplace?And also correlated, whatshould one consider whenevaluating a market asa candidate for buildinga marketplace business?- OK, I'll take the second one first.
If you have a productthat can benefit froma lot of diversity, sothere's a long tail of demand,that's a good one.
You know, diversity or varietyshould make a differencein this market.
Another one is enough roomin the product to havevariety express itself.
Another one is hits areimportant, that more importantgetting the hit, identifying the hit is,let's say you're in the musicbusiness, and you absolutelyhave to know that one hit 'causethe hit's gonna do a huge.
So on the one hand you wantto have a lot of diversity'cause you can get a nice long tail.
On the other hand, if a hitis important in any way,I can net it through thecuration process, through voting,so I like having both aspects.
But I do think in theend having the long tailis more important.
Then a lot of talent, a lotof people who can transactas suppliers is important,so if we did something wherethere were very few artisansin that profession orin the area, it would be hard.
So you need to have enough talent.
- [Reid] Yep.
- [Mariam] Yep.
- [Reid] So from Deanna...
- [Voiceover] Don't worry about it.
- [Reid] OK, thank you.
(laughter)I guess that's super a weakness.
How have you seen the conversationaround diversity shift,or not, since you firstcame to Silicon Valley?What would be the most impactfulactions for individualsor companies to take topromote more diversity?- [Mariam] Hmmm.
- [Reid] And add to that, whatkind of advice would you givefor women entrepreneurs?- OK, well first advice forwomen entrepreneurs would beto start as early as possiblebecause you do have a shorterrunway before life starts tosort of present trade offs.
Let me put it that way.
Family, for example.
So I would take more risks as a female,rather than less risks.
I think women should beencouraged to take far more risksthan men actually, 'causethe time runway is so short.
And I accidentally discoveredthat and benefited from itbecause I was able toafford a nanny and allthis other stuff.
I had the great negotiatingleverage after the first one,that first company.
The other thing I wouldadvise is actually to getmale mentors, not just female mentors.
Everyone's like, oh, youneed a female mentor.
Well actually, if most peoplewho are in positions ofdecision making authorityare male, you actually needa male mentor and malefriends to help you.
And luckily, I'm happy tosay that despite everythingthat's being reported outthere, that most people areactually open minded, it turns out.
And the bad ones get a lot of the press,but the good ones don't,and there are a lot ofgood people to help you.
And I would say almosteverybody who's helped mehas been male.
And the generation behindme is actually even moreenlightened than mygeneration, which is great.
So I have, you know, I reallydo believe that actually,that the Millennial generation is more,things just keep getting better.
- [Reid] Just to clarify'cause I think I know youreasonably well, so I thinkthere's a nuance in whatyou're saying that's important.
- [Mariam] Yes, um hmm.
- [Reid] Make sure youhave male mentors as well.
You can also perfectly fine have women.
- Oh yes, I'm sorry.
- No, I just wanted to make sure.
- Let me make sure that'svery clear on camera.
- Yes, I know you, so Iwanted to make sure you knew.
- So you do, female mentors are important,but they're not the onlything you should go findin terms of mentors.
You should find male mentors as well.
You need to have both.
And many of the peoplewho have helped me reallygain financing and otheraccess to other thingshave been male mentors and friends.
And then the diversityconversation, things have shifteda lot in that in generalgenerational turnover createsmore open mindedness.
It just happens, it's like just natural.
You just wait it out,and things will change.
So it's true, things arechanging, and people areacting on things.
And you know, I look at someVC firms that never fundedfemale entrepreneurs, and thenall of a sudden they've gota couple of female entrepreneursin their portfolio.
So it's very much changing.
People wanna make money, andif you can provide results,and that's the key thing to focus on,that's the number one thing to focus on,they will go where themoney is 'cause they arebusiness people, and theywill want to make money on youessentially, so that would bemy number one piece of adviceis focus on delivering theresults, and everything elseis gonna follow that.
And try to ignore, build your own companythe way you wanna build it with the peopleyou wanna build it with.
- [Reid] Focus on company building.
- Yeah, and get the rightpeople inside your companyare open minded, and it'snot going to eventually bea problem for you, I think.
- [Reid] So I'm gonna ask onequestion, and then open it up.
Like I said, I can continue.
So on the goal of moving pastthe critical failure pointof curation, for example,one purchaser who has toget it right this year, haveyou successfully totallyblown that outta the water?Are you part way down that?- Sorry, say?- You previously looked atthese retail business and saidyou're dependent on one (mumbling).
- Oh yes, yes.
- So is that proven, done,dead, part of the past?Or is it still somethingthat you're coming up to?- I'm feeling very, veryconfident about it now.
Let's say you have a setof best sellers, right?Let's say the traditionalPareto rule is there's an80/20 rule, right?So 80 percent of yoursales are let's say done by20 percent of your assortment.
But take that 80 percent,about 80 percent ofthat 80 percent is now rankingin the top five percentof our votes, OK, of our voted ranking,and the way we apply analytics to voting.
So we do some thingsto the votes to weightcertain voters differently,and those voters fitour predictive model.
- [Reid] Uh huh.
- Yeah, and so we can't talk about that.
Please don't ask me, but Ican't talk about the specifics.
- [Reid] But if I askedyou, you could just say,I can't answer that.
- That's true, I could.
So we have certaincharacteristics that even if younever voted for before we canfit you to and profile you.
We will then weight your vote differently,and then based on that wecan now predict best sellers.
- [Reid] Do you do machine learning,intense data signs?- Not yet, but we're buildinganalytics up right now,so I'm feeling good about that.
- [Voiceover] So for the firstfinancing that you raisedback in 2000, what monthlyrevenue did you have tokeep for that, and howdid you like (mumbling)?- For the Eve.com example,I just tried to networkwith Stanford-- [Reid] And repeat the questiona little bit for the video.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
The question was, for thefirst company, Eve.comwe raised $26 million.
How did we network out way,how did we get an entreeinto raising that money?And did we have to make acertain monthly revenue?Back then people were notfocused at all on proving outthe revenue or the profit.
They just wanted us to gofast, and they were happywhen we produced $10 millionin the first year in revenue,but they were not asking for that at all.
Now for a commerce companyyou probably want to showgood traction, consumertraction before you're going toget funded, I think, potentially,although he's more ofan expert than I am on the funding.
The way we did webasically, my partner wasa HBS alum, and I was a GSP alum.
And we just looked at ournetworks, and we tried tonetwork our way to VCswho would meet with us.
And at that point peoplewere very interested inbusiness school students raising money.
Now the tide, and the tide keep shifting.
Tide's shifted moretowards engineering anduser experience designers.
- [Reid] This is a CS undergraduate class.
- Perfect, you guys arevery well positioned,way better positioned than an MBA.
Back then it was like,who's the MBA who can writea business plan in '98?It's a very outdated model now.
Now it's who's the brilliantengineer paired with agreat designer who could come forward?I don't know if that's trueor not, but you could easily,it's a networking game,networking your way,getting introductions,'cause a lot of the VCs willmeet with people who havebeen referred to them.
Referrals help.
- [Reid] Just to amplifythat, all the quality VCsget call it, minimum 10 to 20 cold pitchesinto their inbox per day, right?You can't even look at them, right?You just, like, it's ah, I'vegot the best new app thing(mumbling) forever, and you're like,I just don't have time to process it.
I don't have time to think about it.
So the proxy that everyone uses issomebody who they trustsays, take a look at this.
This person, this plan,etc., that's always theway it works.
Now if you happen to bealready showing so many pointson the board, where yourtraffic's really growing,they may reach out, they may look for you.
If you say, look, this iswhat my baseline traffic is,they may forward it toan associate and say,take a look at this and seeif this is not assertion,'cause by the way, a bunchof people send in lies, too,when they're doing thisstuff, so it gets very hard todistinguish between signal and noise.
So that's the reason whywhat Mariam is sayingis essentially true.
Now on commerce, generally speaking,it either has to be traction.
- [Mariam] Um hmm.
- Obviously you'll get tractionor a clever enough planthat you went, OK, thisis an interesting gamble.
But it has to be one of the three.
- [Mariam] Um hmm.
- In the back.
- [Voiceover] Yeah, so I wassurprised to hear you say thatyou're tackling bothdigital and physical designsimultaneously because alot of companies have failedwhen they tried to do both.
How are you thinking aboutthat strategy and scaling both?- Yeah, it's nerve wracking.
We spent, we've beenaround now for eight years,and we finally are doing it,so we took a long time, right?So one thing we did was weacquired a company in Januarythat does wedding websites,that made wedding websites.
They're in Kansas City, andwe reskinned them completelywith Minted, pushed allthe community contentto their platform, and that was a success.
Products has launched,it's working beautifully.
So we tried to buy one andstart one, and we'll see.
The story hasn't been told yet.
You know, a couple monthsfrom now I might be wishingI'd bought a digitalinvitations company, too,'cause it's a big learningexperience for us.
And Selena from SurveyMonkey was previously atEvite as their founding CTO.
So we actually called her.
- [Reid] And you're gonna meet Selena.
She's gonna be here.
- It sounds like you'llmeet her, but you know,very carefully I guess is theanswer, and with trepidation.
- [Voiceover] Great product,(mumbling) so thank you.
So you kind of had a twofront war when you werestarting out 'cause youhave both your artists,who are producers, and yourbuyers who are consumers,and you have to reach out to both of them,but you're only a small team.
So as you were scaling up, howdid you allocate resources?- Such a great and insightfulquestion because I felt likeI was constantly runningback and forth betweenthe two audiences, myself, personally.
And I was trying really hard not to let...
I had been mindful of readingabout eBay that they werefocused too much on one, not on the other.
Amazon was on one, not the other.
In the end I felt like inthe end, if I could keepthe designer experience simple,well run and very ethical,that if I produced morerevenue for the designers,that ultimately would keepthem with me long enoughwhile I could get the capitalto make their experienceeven better.
So I bet on, I would run back and forth.
I had to like do double duty.
Marketing, go to market strategy.
Run over to a meetup andmake the designers happy.
Run back over to the marketingstrategy ready sheet.
Pump up the revenue, runback over, back and forth,back and forth.
I can say finally now todayI have a great communityrelations team who takesa lot of that communityrelations management off my hands.
I'm still out there meetingwith designers all the timein our community, like doingmeetups, but I have a big,not big, but nice very greatteam on community relations,and I've got a great team on marketing.
But in the beginning Ihad to do double duty andreally run between the two audiences.
And I tilted towards theconsumer thinking the more thatI built the brand, the moreaspirational I made the brand,and the bigger the revenuegrew, the more of avirtuous cycle I wouldbe providing to fuelcommunity interest in Minted,because the bigger our revenue got,the more designers would beinterested in us essentially.
- So the classic question,excellent question just now.
- Really good, yeah.
- Is there anything that youwould tell your earlier selfto do differently on the prioritization?- I don't actually, I thinkgiven our capital strategy,I would have just raisedmore capital earlier.
That's the only thing I would have done.
- [Reid] And then everythingelse flows downhill.
- And I think everythingwould have flown from there.
We just bought a 3D printerand put one in our officeto play with 'cause I'mfascinated, like what can I makeoutta this, what can we do?So I think it can be done,I think you can crowdsource,but you need to thinkabout a fast to market.
I think you can do 3D, butwe are making pillows nowon demand, so we're making 3D things.
We're making pillows on demand.
- For consumers?- Yeah, so we now make, butthe part that's crowdsourcedis the surface material, the textile.
That's where all the goodnessis, is in the 2D printedmaterial that's just madeinto a couple of standardform factors.
Alright, so we're nottrying to source a differentform factor design, andthen manufacture it,which would be really hard at scale.
So if you're talking aboutproducts, it's threadingthis needle between enoughdifferentiation from theactual crowdsourced contentwith a scalable supply chain,and if that's fast to market.
It's really a needlethat you gotta thread.
- One last question.
- Is there another one?- No, we're good, alright.
- [Mariam] OK.
- [Reid] Thank you very much.
Please give Mariam a hand.
(applause)- [Reid] Well done.
- [Mariam] Thanks.
