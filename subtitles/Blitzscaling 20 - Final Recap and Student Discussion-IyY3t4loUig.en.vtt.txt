WEBVTTKind: captionsLanguage: en- So, thank you everyone.
Those people who have come toall the class sessions and who are herefor the very final class in CS 183C,Technology-Enabled Blitz ScalingWe're gonna be pretty informal todaybecause we have food and drinks outsidewe're gonna be partying a bit.
- But...
(applause and cheering)But, since Stanford seems to want usto approach this is an academic exercise- What?- we thought it would be a good ideato have a final lecture for the class.
So we're gonna keep it pretty,we're gonna keep it pretty informal.
I'm gonna talk a littlebit about the high level,I'll talk a little bit aboutthe high level concepts of the class,and hopefully remind youof some of the classesthat you may have forgotten along the way.
And Allen will talk alittle bit about LinkedInand how some of thelessons have worked there.
And John will bat cleanupand provide information that will beof interest and useful toyou throughout your lives.
- And this should be asinteractive as you can be.
So just raise your hand andask questions as we go along.
- So very quickly, oh yeah,- And what about videoing,just so people know what the videos are?- oh yes, of course!So we are, we are taking videobut at a certain point in timewe'll go ahead and cut it off so thatwe're not gonna videotape the entire party,just the part we'rehaving this discussion.
(audience laughs)And besides which, it'sgonna be really hardto talk into this microphonewhile eating a burrito.
Chris.
- [Voiceover] Are there any questionsthat won't be videoed or--- [John] Yeah, we can do that,- [Allen] Yes, yeah.
- so we'll turn off the video.
Definitely, we'll turn off the video.
- Definitely turn off the video.
- Yeah, we'll turn off the video.
And I guess re--- [Man on right] But not yet.
- [John] And I guessReid sends his regards.
He's doing annual LinkedInfiling types of things,which is what happens as youget to these atrocious scales.
(Allen laughs)By atrocious, I mean awesome.
- [Allen] Yes, awesome.
- Awesomely atrocious.
- [John] Awesome and a littlebit more painful to run,unless you're compassionate,as we learned.
(audience laughs)- At any rate.
So as you know, this classis about blitz scaling,which is rapid, relentless growth.
And we've looked at alot of different issuesaround blitz scaling overthe course of the class.
Probably one of the mostimportant things to start withis, when do you blitz-scale?And we talked withpeople like Mariam Naficyover at Minted, whoactually talked about howshe spent years growing the companybefore she shifted to blitz-scaling.
We also talked withBrian Chesky at Airbnb,who talked about how,interestingly enough,an external threat, the Samwer brothers,actually caused Airbnbto dramatically increasethe pace of expansion,especially into Europe.
So what we see withblitz-scaling is that often timesthe external conditions willdetermine whether or notit makes sense to startthe blitz-scaling process.
We also saw that sometimesblitz-scaling occurswhether you like it or not.
Shishir Mehrotra talkedabout how, at YouTubehe went into the CFO's officeand the CFO put up the chartsof how much money they were spendingand how quickly that amountwas growing and said,"This may very well bethe worst business model"the world has ever seen."Well that's blitz-scaling,but that's blitz-scaling thatyou actually have to address,not just as a strategy but asa condition in and of itself.
And finally, I want youguys to think back towhen Reed Hastings from Netflixcame and he talked aboutthe importance of networkeffects to blitz-scaling.
I think that Allen maycomment on it a little bitin terms of LinkedIn.
But one of the key reasons to blitz-scaleis when there are returnsto being the firstperson to achieve scale.
And as Reid pointed out,there are certain businesseswhere those returns don't exist.
Many years ago they starteda company called CDNow,which sold CDs online.
Probably all of us were customersa bit way back when.
But as soon as Amazon began selling CDs,they were flattened like thecoyote by the road runner.
So there were no network effects there,but for a company like LinkedInthere are very strong network effects.
Now let me touch upon that later on.
The lessons of how do you blitz-scale,the techniques of blitz-scaling?Well one thing you guyshave probably all heard,from Paul Graham and many others,is to do things that don't scale.
And we saw how many of the speakerswho came in, in fact didthings that didn't scale,whether it was Larry and Sergeiinterviewing every singlecandidate at Google,and putting all sorts of crazy ruleson who they could and couldn't hire,and then breaking allthose rules all along.
Brian Chesky talking about howhe actually went to his various hostsand photographed theirapartments for them,because they did aterrible job on their own.
And they were like, "Wait a minute.
"This is the CEO, I just signed up"and he signed me up, and he comes over,"and he photographs it, andhe's bringing in air mattresses.
"This is kinda weird."But, and then obviously hedoesn't do that any longer,but it was important to achieving scale.
And, remember Nirav Toliatalking about Nextdoor,and how his engineers didn't believethey could possibly get 100neighborhoods that first summer,and they would actually go door to doorto make sure they couldget their neighborhoods.
This is an internet startupworking like a Fuller Brushsalesman going door to door.
But once you get that first 100 fans,those 100 people that love your company,then you can get on tothe blitz-scaling train.
And as the company grows, all of a sudden,you have to start changing what you do.
Maybe in some cases it involves people,hiring from the outside.
We heard from SelinaTobaccowala over at SurveyMonkeythat one of the key thingsthey did at SurveyMonkeywas to begin to bringpeople in from the outsidewho had the experienceof scaling the technologythat the internal team didn't have.
Sometimes it was by acquisition.
We also heard from,let's see looking at my notes,we also heard from MariamNaficy over at Minted.
She wanted to grow herteam from the insideand when she wasn't blitz-scaling,she had the luxury to go aheadand give them the time to develop.
But once they were movingat such an aggressive pace,she had to look outside.
Although she did have astrategy, as you may recall.
She went and hired peoplefor HR and Finance and things like that,who had the experience,and tried to keep the internalpeople focused on the productand the business side of the world.
But the interesting thing is,even though you're tryingto change what you do,as a founder, as a CEO,which both of you have been,you also need to keepsome things the same.
And some of the things thatI'll remember from the classare the ways in which, evenat the most enormous scales,the leaders were trying to findways to keep things the same.
So remember how EricSchmidt would talk aboutproducts at Google.
One of the big things was,"Hey, very great project starts off as"one professor and one grad student."And they would continuallybreak it up into small teams.
And I think that that's a theme you sawwith the number of the folks involved.
It's also a question of culture.
I think that we've talkeda lot about cultureover the course of the class,and that's something thatactually Reid has beenemphasizing a lot recently as well.
How culture is the way that wehold each other accountable.
We hold each other accountable as peersand horizontally inaddition to the verticalaccountability of management.
And as the companygrows larger and larger,if you rely on vertical management,you as an individual canonly touch so many people.
And there are so many layersbetween you and the peopleyou're trying to affect thatyou need to use mechanismslike the Netflix culture deckor like Brian Chesky's weekly e-mailsin order to reach everyone.
- You know, I think thethings that occurred to meas we went through the things,where it kind of jumped out of meis how clear, maybe three things were.
One is how clear eachof the leaders was aboutthe phasing of the company,about how you're in thisphase that you needed to scalethis particular thing but not that.
And I think they were allsuper articulate aboutwhen they were in a marketing blitz-scale,or user growth blitz-scaleor what have you.
And I wasn't sure thatwas gonna be the case,but in retrospect it feltlike that in Mozilla too.
We were clearly in a user-growth timeand then we weren't quite sure how toget out of that user-growth time.
Well that was one of the things.
The second thing I would observe is thatI think everybody, withexception of one or two people,they were thirsty for findingother people to learn from,and other models to learn from.
And it was all really obvious whenyou had one or twospeakers who didn't do thatand were trying to inventeverything from scratch.
I think it's harder when you're tryingto invent everything.
It's easier when you go talk to models,you're aggressive about finding mentors,you talked about BillCampbell for example in that.
So those are the two bigthings I would take away.
But then the third thing I'd say,is when Jeff was talking about compassion.
He spent a lot of timetalking about organizational compassion.
I think that that would beanother way to talk aboutculture or these e-mails, whatever.
When I talk about culture, when I say,I talk about alignment,which is how do you,how do you help peoplemake the same decisionswhether you are in the room or not?And how do you make,like how do you set the rules of the road?I would say that my observation is thateverybody was looking for models outside,everybody is clear about phases,and what was important when,and then they were all clear abouthow to get alignment in the organization.
And in the alignment conversation,and you guys probably noticed this,like Jeff, we hardlytalked at all our products,we talked almost all aboutorganizational compassion,organizational alignment.
I think the bigger youget, the more you lookfor these leverage tools to do that.
- It's difficult to find outsort of what phase you're inwhen you're actually in the midst of it.
It's like the boundariesare not super clear.
But the need, and Jeff emphasized this,for speed and quality decision makingand being willing to say, you know,that's exactly where weneed to be right now.
Even if you're not 100% right,at least you've decided.
I think is key, becauseknowing where you arein the process actually means a lotfor your ability to be able to executein a particular location.
If you don't know thenyou're gonna get very fuzzy,and it's gonna get extremely difficultto actually make it succeed.
- And I think we didn't,sorry, one second,I think we'd even look atcounter-examples too muchby companies that did blitz-scaleand now who didn't, I guess,Maybe Yahoo is the big example on that.
I think even with Marissa,you heard a lot abouthow do you recreate theconditions and recreate alignmentso you can get back to where you wereand where you started.
I think maybe if, in the future,we might try to findsomebody willing to come inand talk about the counter case,where it was going up and then down.
What do you have?- [Voiceover] (speakingoff mic) a few days agoas well, but from like avery naive perspective,you look at a lot of the majorSilicon Valley techcompanies, you're like,"Oh they all seem to havethe same (speaking off mic)"- Oh that's not, yeah that's not culture.
- That's not culture.
- [John] That's not a culture.
- [Voiceover] Oh okay, so whatwould be, I guess where is--- Yeah, so here's the thing.
The question is more of less, like look,every Silicon Valley companyhas the same culture,you got skateboards and freefood and slack and all that.
- Perks.
- Yeah so culture ishow you make decisions,that's the whole thing.
- Yeah, and how, so andJeff has a very distinctive,and he might have mentioned it--- I culture is super misunderstood.
Profoundly misunderstood.
- So you have values whichhelp you make decisions,you have have culture which defineshow you work together andthose things together,culture and values isprimarily about ensuringthat different teams wherever you areno matter where you're livingor what you're working onthey have the same sortof rules of engagementto allow them to worktogether effectively.
- And then culture is bothin the things that you doand then also things you don't do,whether you, how you hire,how you talk about your customers,how you talk about your partners.
It's everything, but it's primarilyhow do you make decisionsfrom very large decisionsto very small decisions.
And how do you try to makesure that the organizationmakes them in a consistent way.
And free food doesn't reallyhave anything to do with that.
Free food is a tacticaround how do you get peopleto talk to each other.
You know, letting people have scootersor whatever or hoverboards in the office,like that's just a thing you do,'cause that's what people like doing.
But that's not theimportant bits of culture.
- I think it's also important to notethat so many of the elements of cultureare set in the very early stages of scale.
I think that having beenthere from the very beginning,Allen, I think you can seethat there are key elementsof LinkedIn culture that are establishedwhen you were all injust one room together.
- It's absolutely ridiculous.
It's almost like the interactionsthe founders have with each other,basically get expandedto basically describethe way the entire sort oflike physics of a system works,the physics of a culturework in the future.
It's very remarkable.
You have to be aware of it.
But, trying to shape ittoo much is a mistake.
It's just not a good use of time.
- [Voiceover] Sure.
- [Voiceover] What are some examplesof distinctions inculture that you've seen?- Examples of distinctionsin culture that we've seen,well (mumbles) Google's pretty differentand Twitter's prettydifferent than Facebook.
Like what are good examplesof why that's true?- So I think that we've heardthat there are not goodcultures and bad cultures.
There are strong culturesand weak cultures.
- I don't buy that, just for the record.
I know Brian said thatand Brian's super smart,so maybe he's right,but that doesn't feel right to me.
I think there--- So it depends on--- [John] I have objectivelyobserved horrible cultures.
- So what you've objectivelyobserved culturesthat were, yeah we're not gonna,we're not gonna name those names.
- Not only weak, but strong and bad.
- After we turn off the video,maybe we'll name some of those names.
But, the definition, againthe definition of cultureis not necessarily doesit make people happyor even does it makethe company effective,although that I think is agood way to judge a culture.
The question of the cultureis how much does it shapethe behavior of the people in it?- Yeah, so maybe one example, so you know,Jeff Bezos and Amazon culturegot pretty pillary recently.
I think Amazon has a very distinct culturearound very hard work.
But also being intenselyprepped for every meeting.
So you know any meaningfulmeeting on Amazondoesn't have a slide deck.
It starts with a two pageor three page write up.
And everybody sits in silenceand reads the write upfor the first 10 or 15minutes of the meeting.
What that says iseverybody who's doing thisis gonna read up, you'regonna have time to read,and you expect them to come in engaged,not just talk to slides.
That's a good example of aculture that has impacts.
Apple, for example, is differentnow than when I was there.
But it has an extremely segmented culturethat only comes togetherat the very top of the organization.
And so, if you ask people whatproject they're working on,at Apple, what I'veheard people say is thatthey often spend a lot ofthe beginnings of meetingstrying to figure outwho's disclosed on what,who's allowed to know whatand talk about to the others.
So you figure that out.
Now, it's hard to be critical of Apple,'cause that place works likea (audio cuts out) charm.
Like a dream.
It's a great company.
But it's not one that I could run.
And Mozilla, we were the opposite.
At Mozilla we were completelyopen and transparent.
And anything anybody wantedto talk about, I talked about.
In public, within often,actually on the weband Twitter and stuff.
- Probably the best example,the best known exampleof a culture for an organizationis the military culture.
Military culture is extremely distinctive.
It's extremely hierarchal,it's extremely organized and disciplined.
And it works great.
Would you do that with a company?I don't know, but it's agreat example of a culture.
- People have tried, itusually doesn't work.
Especially in Silicon Valley.
(man speaks off mic)- There's a bunch, like one or--- So the question is what is it?Excitable question to ask?- How do you try to figure outif you're interviewingor something like that.
How do you figure out whatquestions you're gonna askto figure out what the culture is?I think often it's how do you disagree,how do you fight, how do you argue.
I think poking around that'sprobably most important.
Like so what happens if I have an ideaand I disagree with you, CEO?And trying to figure that out.
And to the extent you can,work through a really concrete,as far down as you can in the details.
- Agreed.
- One other question I willask people about cultureis I'll say, well can youtell me about the last timethat the culture causedyou to make a decisionthat went against thefinancial incentives?Because ultimately if yourcultural values don't actuallyoverride the financial considerations,then you don't actuallyhave cultural values.
- What are some things people notice?I think maybe, it was probablymaybe four or five weeks ago,we just started talkingto leaders of verylarge organizations now.
What are some things that surprised peopleas we went through, anything?- [Voiceover] I mean one thingthat really confirmed my own experiences,but also like it seems likehiring is really difficultand also the most important thing.
Because essentially all thethings that people talk about,whether it's like compassion methodor all of these tools and like tool boxes,kinda underlie like good people.
Like you have to have goodpeople and scare trust.
You don't have that,you don't have compassion matching,you don't have, you know firingin a nice way or whatever.
You don't have anythingelse like that, so.
I mean if there's one question I have,I would never have asked you earlier,as you're blitz-scalingwhere you have to havespeed of hiring, like how do you actually,I mean where do you drawyour line with hiring?- Yeah so I mean you're basically saying,you said it's like one observationis that people andhiring is the main thingand how do you get great people?My two cents with it is almostanybody who's been successfulwill tell you they spend most of the timetrying to figure outhow to get great peoplein their organization,how to let them win,and that's kind of it.
How to try to help them win.
So, I was talking to somebody,every once in a whileas a venture capitalistyou see lots of founders,and so we saw a founder the other dayand I had a very strong positive reactionand this other person had avery strong negative reaction,which is kind of unusual for us as a team.
And I was trying to figure it out,'cause like I think atthis point in my careerI've had probably, I'veprobably done 10,000 interviewsand I've probably hired athousand or two thousand people.
And so I feel like I'vegotten a fairly good sense,and you start to develop over time.
But even this part 20 years in,10,000 interviews, whatever it is,like it's still hard to assessand you still makemistakes and you find it,it's a little bit aboutwhere your mental state isand their mental state is.
But, I mean I guess thefirst thing I would sayis you just practice, practice,practice, keep doing it.
The other thing is I wouldsay as an organization,especially early you need totalk about it with each other.
So I was talking to another organizationthat's 20 people andthey're trying to figure outhow much to quote standardizetheir interview process.
And they're pre-launched,they won't launchfor probably six or eight or 12 months.
I was encouraging them tokinda standardize it now.
And talk about the partsof the interview processand then talk about it together.
Because they have time now without beingthe pressure of it publicly launched.
And so talk about it, talkabout it, talk about it,'cause then a bunch of thatstuff'll become 2nd natureby the time they launch, bythe time they run out of timeto talk about it.
- I think one thing Ialso wanna do a call backto Patrick Collison of Stripe who came in,and one of the things thatstruck me in what he saidwas well do you want to hire peoplefrom the pool of peoplewho walk in the door and apply to youor do you wanna hire people from the poolof the greatest people in the worldat whatever it is that they're doing?And hiring isn't just a matter ofhey, I'm gonna put the job listing upand I'm gonna hope people come in.
You know people go out there and saywell they talked to their employees,who's the smartest person you know?And they go out and they find those peopleand they bring them in.
Other questions?I'm gonna use the microphoneas a way to bring thequestions to people as well.
As a matter of fact, new innovation.
So pick someone close.
(laughter)- [Voiceover] So I think wewere talking about surprising--(man speaks off mic)- [Voiceover] surprisingthings and it seemedincredibly insightful abouthow you identify young peoplewho have a lot of potentialand will do great things in the future.
And Google hires great people, right?I mean the best programmers goand they wanna go and work at Google.
But if you think about the best productsthat Google has come up with,they're all acquisition based.
And it just tells me that evenif you have the best peopleinside the organization, youhave all the money, you just,it's not easy to comeup with these product--- Can we impact that a little bit?So, you said the programmersall wanna go to Google.
We should debate that for a little while.
It's 2015, is that still true?I don't know, let's just talk about it.
The 2nd thing is, you saidwell all their good productscame out through acquisition.
Was that true?- [Voiceover] Except the searchengine, one of the biggest(speaks too quiet off mic to be heard)- Gmail.
- [Allen] Gmail.
- But aside from Google search and Gmail.
(laughter)- [Voiceover] Android maps, all the--- Maps was internal, well--- [Allen] No, Maps was not internal.
- Maps is keyhole and keyhole turn,it's a little bit morecomplicated than that,because Maps is a fusion of Lars and Brettand Brett was internal.
- [Voiceover] Plus ads, like the ad tech.
- Ads were pretty well.
- [Voiceover] But it's also a product.
- So this is actually one of the thingsthat Allen was talkingabout on the way in,which is how do you thinkabout trying to create,as you get very large, thingsyou do to be innovativeare maybe different thanthe things you did before.
I would argue actuallythat Google's been betterat creating internal innovationthan almost any company inthe history of the world.
Google.
Oh, Apple's a special case.
I find it hard to, Ipersonally find it hardto reason from Apple as a starting point,because it's such an outlier of company.
But, what I was gonna say is I think,I find Google interesting.
I think they've been actuallyvery consistently innovative.
You can argue about whether,Google Plus was any good or notand stuff like that.
(laughter)You can't argue very much.
(laughter)But like Google photos is alegitimately great product.
Came 100% internal.
And so, but then the way Google innovatesis pretty different thanthe way Facebook innovates.
I think Facebook you couldargue right now has moreacquisition based culture.
Whats App, Oculus,Instagram, three examples.
Although, like they have a huge AI lab nowand they've got drones coming too.
So they've got, they'redoing innovation too.
Do you have a point of view?- Yeah, there's a senseof which, I mean as you,this is actually one of the thingsI think is worth following up onfrom the OS 4 and OS 5 conversations.
When you're actuallygrowing, so as we said,OS 3 is about like doublingvalue, your core business.
OS 4 is essentially aboutbuilding that businessand making it a mature one.
And OS 5 is about how do you extendbeyond where you actually are.
So, the problem is,and if you're going through OS 3 and OS 4,and basically you've increasedthe size of your companya hundred fold, during that time,the issue is that the people you've hired,you've hired in large partbecause they're extraordinary operators,because they're very,very good at what they do.
You've come to the placewhere you've hired a bunch of specialistsand in some ways you've weeded outthe original entrepreneurial,or at least you've attenuatedthe entrepreneurialapproach within a companyby basically reallyemphasizing operations.
So then the question islike when you get to OS 5and LinkedIn just crossedthe OS 5 boundary,like literally two weeks ago,we're now just over 10,000 people.
So, with that in mind, like how do youactually build disruptive innovation?How do you create new things?You've already mentioned Facebook.
Facebook basically has theability based on the strengthof their existing business,to buy their way intoadditional innovation.
LinkedIn we've hired a bunch of peopleand some of our most innovativeleaders inside LinkedInare the people who camefrom those acquisitions.
Which is actually very powerful.
But then the question islike how do you actuallyhome brew it as well?You can invest in that or you can saywe're gonna do it through acquisition.
It kinda depends on sort ofwhat your business looks likeand the way you wanna approach itand who you have toactually run those things.
'Cause recreating anentrepreneurial environmentcan be really tough.
But this challenge of how do you go from,we went from extremelyinnovative to super successfuland how do we get backto extremely innovativeis a real challenge.
- I think Google is actuallya very, very positive case.
'Cause again we forgotthe self-driving car,like Google's had a numberof projects they boughtthat have succeeded andinvented associated.
And I was serious when I saidI think it's probably themost successful companyin the history of the world in terms ofgenerating internal innovationthat are unrelated to their core products.
That have the potential tocreate other core businesses.
It just doesn't happen very much.
- [Voiceover] I would also say thatApple's kind mischaracterized,I think if you see itas doing everythinginternally, when Tony Fadellkinda brought the iPod in,the O A days was all out of Xerox Park.
I mean Steve Jobs hada policy of no researchat Apple, for years, right?He would wait for a great laband an academic institutionto do a really cool thing.
And then find out how to productize itand distribute it and market it (mumbles).
I think it's super valuable,but I just think of it asinnovation as being likehaving a blank slate,inventing something,kinda (mumbling) model,oh it's all from scratch, all from inside.
It's interesting,but not necessarilysomething I'm gonna do.
- I think Apple has a bunchof processes of innovation,a bunch of user experience innovation,a bunch of manufacturing innovation.
Like it's pretty hardto argue that the iPhonewasn't profoundly innovative.
You know, on a bunch of a different--- [Voiceover] Oh, totally, Iworked at Apple for a whileand I loved it, I'm justsaying I think the--- Oh I'm not being defensive about Apple,like we're all Apple fanboys, or whatever, but like.
(man mumbles and laughs at mic)- [Student in white] Couldyou guys talk a little bitabout tactics and strategiesto help convince other peopleto work with you?- Help other people work with you.
- You mean how to hire people?- [Student in white] Yeah,but not just finding talent,but being able to convincethem that they shouldcome work with you and not someone else.
- Yeah, be really good and have otherreally good people around you mostly.
(laughter)I'm not kidding,- [Allen] That's really it.
- Work on something that matters.
Have really smart people doing it.
And be able to explain why it matters.
I think that's not--- Couldn't agree more.
I mean just the ability for me to sayI'm gonna go work everyday, to work every day,I'm gonna work with somebodywho's really awesome.
Man, that matters morethan almost anything elsein terms of attractingsomebody to a space.
And then you've got peoplewho are aligned with a missionor aligned with thetechnology they wanna useor they're gonna have arole which aligns withwho they are personally.
You got those things, youhave a great argument.
LinkedIn fights on this all the time.
Because basically we haveto fight every startupand every big company interms of attracting talent.
How do we continue to get good talent?Well just so happens thatour culture, our values,our missions, everything arereally our differentiator.
And that has allowed usto attract good peopleand now we have good peoplewe can offer as well.
- And at the end of the day--- I know you feel like, theway you're looking at me,you probably feel it's likewe're just glossing over it,but we're not.
That was a specific and real answer.
(laughter)- Come down the video the face,to see what I'm talking about.
(all three talking over each other)- What I would also say is, Imean I think that the advicethat John or Allen would give to youis basically that there'sno certainty in this worldin terms of which startups are gonna work.
There's no certainty as towhat products are gonna work.
I mean, shocking as this may sound,not every investment worksout and not every companygoes on to become Facebook or Googleor LinkedIn as the case were.
So, many times the only thingyou can actually controlis who you choose to work with.
And as you guys go out there,those of you who areundergrads or grad studentsgoing out into the workforceand working for folks,part of it's gonna be the mission,part of it's gonna be thetechnology you get to work on,but part of it is justare these the peopleI wanna spend the nextseveral years of my life with,probably more time than I would spendwith any immediate family member,is that what I reallywanna do with me life?- And for what it's worth,it's also the peopleyou'll create your next startup with.
'Cause you're gonnacreate the next startupwith the people you're working withat your current company.
- Okay, I'm gonna go tothe back row on this side.
- [Voiceover] Thank you.
I wanna ask as questionI didn't really get to ask Jeff Weiner.
And so I think he talked a lotabout compassionate management.
A lot of people did, talkabout sort of the ideaof leading by inspiring people.
And that's extremely importantand I'm trying to figureout how to combine thatwith keeping people working hard.
I mean at the same timeyou're in a startup,you have people who, you know,usually during the first couple monthseverybody just has to work hard as fuck.
And certainly that's truein stages one or two,it might be less trueat LinkedIn right now,but I went and asked him afterwards,what do you do with somebodywho's really inspiredfrom 11 am. to three pm.
and he said, that's fine.
And I disagree, so, whatdo you do about that?- Is that fine, do youhave people who workfrom 11 to three at LinkedIn?Because I've got,(laughing)I'm interested.
That sounds great!- I don't think we have anybodywho works from 11 to three.
Sorry to disappoint.
I think, so,every employee basically has four,this is just off the top of myhead, but has four main areaswhich encourage them to participate.
So the first one, the most important one,is your own motivation,whatever it actually is.
Second one is leadership,which basically allows youto align your own motivationwith what's actually happening.
This is something that Jeffis totally extraordinary at.
The 3rd one is you havedirectives, you have your managerwho's telling you what to do.
This is actually thedifference between, as he said,the difference betweenleadership and management.
Management is about like responsibility,are we actually getting all the shit donethat we signed up to get done.
And the final thing is your colleagues.
So, those colleagues, if yousee the people around youworking hard, you'regonna work hard as well.
So it's not like theleader is alone responsiblefor making those things happen.
The leader can beresponsible for making surethat people feel themotivation and understandin their own minds how thethings that they're doingconnect to the things they care about.
That's really what leadership is,that's what inspiration is about.
- Yeah, I think compassionis a misunderstood wordin this context.
I don't think it meansbeing gentle or nice,- Definitely not.
- [John] or soft.
I think what you're trying to dois try to understand andyou're trying to figure outhow to get, close gaps isthe way I would put it.
So, a lot of times, especiallywith my directs at Mozilla,they said oh I think I should be a VPor I think I should bethis level or that levelor whatever.
And I said, okay, I hear you.
Let's talk about what the delta isbetween where you are nowand what you aspire to be.
So let's talk about thegap between here and there.
And let's talk about how toquantify and understand the gaps.
And then let's talk aboutwhat we can do to close them.
And then, let's try to figureout a plan to close those gapsover the next 90 days or180 days, or whatever.
And if we can demonstrate that,then we'll give you what you want.
If you can't, we won't,we'll do something different.
And so I think that what I would argueis that that's a veryspecific metrics driven wayto understand somebody, what they want,and try to give it to them.
Which I think isfundamentally compassionate.
But it's not really aboutyeah you wanna work like four hours a day.
I think that the compassionword will confuse peopleand I think Jeff wentkind of way out of his wayto explain that it wasn't reallyjust being nice to people.
But yeah, I think that,yeah I don't know,that's what I would say.
- I think two more questionsthen we'll turn off thecamera so you can reallyask some good questions.
So since I'm lazy I'mgonna go to the first row.
- [Voiceover] My questionis about product market fitand how we've talked abouthow it's reiterative process.
So you do it multiple timesuntil you figure it out.
But like, Brian Chesky went a yearand he admitted that him and his buddieswere like, you know, workingon some other side stuffand then like they alsokinda were not necessarilydoing the Airbnb thing,they made a rent a roommate.
The VC from Floodgate talkedabout how the lift peopleworked for multiple yearson like other stuff,but then you got like Facebook,you've got Survey Monkey,like the startup about Survey Monkey.
So, I guess the questionis if product market fitis like the biggest thing at OS 1, right?Like then how can you justifyworking on something that,what should the expectation be?Should the expectationbe of building something,like Survey Monkey and refine it, right?Or should the expectation be like oh no,like that's that deep corefundamental intuition,like Brian Chesky had with Airbnband try different ways of making it work?- Good question.
- Look, everyone's different.
And we work and we play and welearn for different reasons.
And so I think,I think product market fit is important.
And it's important to be successful,but equally importantis working on somethingyou give a damn about.
And so what I would say is thatfinding product marketfit in something you hateis kind of a disaster because you're like(audio cuts out) this is a great businessand I really hate doing it.
You know and for me, like,(laughter)like you laugh,- [Voiceover] It happens.
- many entrepreneurs, you ask them,it's like do you like ad servingor do you like insurance brokering?And they're like no, but this is like,it's a top down, it's abig marketing opportunity,I can't avoid it.
And I think I've got this angle.
And you laugh but it's not,a lot of people intellectualizethemselves into sayinghere's a thing I can buildthat will totally work.
And I think that's a goodway to start building thingsthat don't matter andyou don't care about.
Some people, for some peoplethat totally works for themand they'll build the company upand they'll sell it and then they'll golive on the beach orwhatever they wanna do.
For some others it doesn't workand so I think it's thatquestion, answering that questionyou have to understanda lot about who you areand what you care about and how you run.
I don't know how you guys would answer.
- Yeah I would say for most of you though,and again because you're here at Stanford,amazing institution, obviouslywe're very big fans of it,- [John] Acceptable.
- Exactly.
(Allen laughing)But for most of you, you'reprobably gonna succeedat whatever you end up trying to do.
And you'll know thisbecause the school's gonnahammer you relentlesslywith appeals for moneyfrom now until the day you die.
(laughter)And so, if you're probablygonna be successful,why don't you go ahead andtry to find a way to besuccessful at somethingthat you actually enjoy.
And I do think that alot of what you should dois to look inside yourself andlook at what are the thingsthat you've actually tried and enjoyed.
A lot of people try tointuit the meaning of lifeor the purpose of their life.
I'm like that's kinda hard to do,why don't you try doing stuff.
And do more of the stuffthat seems to feel right.
- And the things thatactually motivate youare gonna be different and theways in which you approach itare gonna be different.
Intuition is actually, somepeople really rely on intuitionand in a lot of ways a goodpiece of recommendationis work on somethingwhich is actually solvinga problem for yourself.
Because then you can takeadvantage of your own intuitionsabout what a solution actually looks like.
But, there are people outthere who are motivatedby building a great businessor by executing an amazingstrategy or whatever,and those sets of motivationsare equally valid.
Whatever it is has gottagive you the motivationto get up out of bedafter four hours of sleepand go back and do it again.
- Alright, so, you had your hand up.
This'll be the last televised question.
- [Voiceover] So one thing Ithought that was interestingBrian Chesky was talkingabout how now where Airbnb is,he said he could take two months offand it would more or less run the same.
And the two big questionshe was saying was,what's our second product and how do Iallow the culture to expand.
While we're expanding how doI keep the culture intact?So, how have you guys moved frommore of an operator to amore strategic, big picture,I'll even say fuzzier,longer term operation?You know capacity and how didthat change your daily routineand how did that change your thinking,how, just all of that.
- Do you want me to talk about that?- So my original role atLinkedIn, as you know,was I was the original head of product.
And then I ended up running a big,as we got biggerI ran a big section ofthe product organization.
And then two years ago I made a shiftfrom a sort of silent operational rolewhere I ran product for a bigchunk of what we actually did,into a central strategy role.
Part of the reason Iactually did that, was thatI am pretty good at thinkingabout the big strategy,so forth, and most importantlythe company needed somebodycentral in the product organizationwho had broad visibility into itwho moreover had the abilityto actually influenceour strategy at scale.
That influence actuallycomes from the factthat I'm a founder.
Founders have strangepowers at organizations.
And those strange powersare kind of a form of moral authority.
And that moral authority is somethingthat you can use to getpeople to listen to you.
On stuff which, in our case,is outside the operational realm.
So I made this move to thecenter because it allowed,because basically I'm kindof uniquely positionedto be able to have that strategicinfluence in the company.
So my transition was completelyfrom literally day to day,one on ones, managing people,signing expense reports,doing quarterly planning,reporting things out,fixing the dashboards,all the other stuff you need to dowhen you're like, havepurely operational role.
- Working for a living.
- But now I get there at11 and I leave at three.
(laughter)That's actually not true,but now I spend timeworking with every single product leaderin the organization,just sitting down and workingwith them on strategy.
And then trying to bring itall together in one place.
So it's a radicallydifferent kind of work.
- My only sort of caution to you would beit's hard to go the other direction.
So it's hard to go,so I started my career at technicaland then I moved to managementand then I moved from managementto meta-management, then managementto whatever I do now.
And as Chris Barber, who'san intern at GreyLock,will tell you, my direct management skillspretty well suck rightnow and they're way betterthan my coding skills areso it's very hard to go,it gets, I would stay astechnical and stay as hands onas long as you possibly can,because it's very, very hardto go the other direction again.
- So with that, one last thing.
Since our esteemed colleagueReid isn't here today,I figured I'd end by quoting him,or at least paraphrasing him.
- Good, because notenough people quote Reid.
(laughing)That's good, we're gonnaget him a little air time.
- There you go, this is for you, Reid.
(laughter)So as you know, one of the thingsthat Reid likes to talk aboutis that launching a startupis like jumping off a cliffand assembling anairplane on the way down.
And what he's gonna needto do to add to that sayingis in fact you have todo it multiple times.
Because each time your company scales upto a next phase, it's essentially likeyou found another cliff,and you jumped off itand now you gotta buildanother damn airplane.
So, hopefully we've takenthe topics of this classand given you guys some of the toolsto build those airplanes.
And we're looking forward toseeing what you guys build.
Thanks.
